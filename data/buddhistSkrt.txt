https//bitly/2gSttKk, 15 To him there was a queen named Māyā as if free from all deceit (māyā) — an effulgence proceeding from his effulgence like the splendour of the sun when it is free from all the influence of darkness a chief queen in the united assembly of all queens,tasyātiśobhāvisṛtātiśobhā raviprabhevāstatamaḥ prabhāvā |samagradevīnivahāgradevī babhūva māyāpagateva māyā || 115*
https//bitly/2gSttKk, 16 Like a mother to her subjects intent on their welfare — devoted to all worthy of reverence like devotion itself — shining on her lord’s family like the goddess of prosperity — she was the most eminent of goddesses to the whole world,prajāsu māteva hitapravṛttā gurau jane bhaktirivānuvṛttā |lakṣmīrivādhīśakule kṛtābhā jagatyabhūduttamadevatā yā || 116*

https//bitly/2gSttKk, 61 This is the true way in which those seer kings of old rejecting through duty all trivial riches 35 have ever flung them away as was right — being poor in outward substance but rich in ascetic endurance,etacca tadyena nṛparṣayaste dharmeṇa sūkṣmāṇi dhanānyapāsya |nityaṁ tyajaṁto vidhivadbabhūvustapobhirāḍhyā vibhavairdaridrāḥ || 161 (156)

https//bitly/2gSttKk, 78 By the rain of the Law he will give gladness to the multitude who are consumed in this world with that fire of desire whose fuel is worldly objects as a great cloud does with its showers at the end of the hot season,vidahyamānāya janāya loke rāgāgnināyaṁ viṣayeṁdhanena |prahlādamādhāsyati dharmavṛṣṭyā vṛṣṭyā mahāmegha ivātapāṁte || 178 (173)
https//bitly/2gSttKk, 79 He will break open for the escape of living beings that door whose bolt is desire and whose two leaves are ignorance and delusion — with that excellent blow of the good Law which is so hard to find,tṛṣṇārgalaṁ mohatamaḥkapāṭaṁ dvāraṁ prajānāmapayānahetoḥ |vipāṭayiṣyatyayamuttamena saddharmatāḍena durāsadena || 179 (174)
https//bitly/2gSttKk, 80 He the king of the Law when he has attained to supreme knowledge will achieve the deliverance from its bonds of the world now overcome by misery destitute of every refuge and enveloped in its own chains of delusion,svairmohapāśaiḥ pariveṣṭitasya duḥkhābhibhūtasya nirāśrayasya |lokasya saṁbudhya ca dharmarājaḥ kariṣyate baṁdhanamokṣameṣaḥ || 180 (175)

https//bitly/2gSttKk, 82 Therefore since I have fallen short of that excellence though I have accomplished all the stages of contemplation my life is only a failure since I have not heard his Law I count even dwelling in the highest heaven a misfortune’,bhraṣṭasya tasmācca guṇādato me dhyānāni labdhvāpyakṛtārthataiva |dharmasya tasyāśravaṇādahaṁ hi manye vipattiṁ tridive pi vāsam || 182 (177)

https//bitly/2gSttKk, 94 Thus at the good fortune of the birth of the king’s son that city surnamed after Kapila with all the surrounding inhabitants was full of gladness like the city of the lord of wealth 47 crowded with heavenly nymphs at the birth of his son Nalakūvara,iti narapatiputrajanmavṛddhyā sajanapadaṁ kapilāhvayaṁ puraṁ tat |dhanadapuramivāpsaro vakīrṇaṁ muditamabhūnnalakūvaraprasūtau || 194 (189)

https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 49 Standing in the paths of the pre-eminent kings who flourished in primaeval ages he practised austerities without laying aside his white garments and he offered in sacrifice only those things which involved no injury to living creatures,sthitvā pathi prāthamakalpikānāṁ rājarṣabhāṇāṁ yaśasānvitānām |śuklānyamuktvāpi tapāṁsyatapta yajñe ca hiṁsārahitairayaṣṭa || 249
https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 50 He of holy deeds shone forth gloriously in the splendour of royalty and the splendour of penances conspicuous by his family and his own conduct and wisdom and desirous to diffuse brightness like the sun,ajājvaliṣṭātha sa puṇyakarmā nṛpaśriyā caiva tapaḥśriyā ca |kulena vṛttena dhiyā ca dīptastejaḥ sahasrāṁśurivotsisṛkṣuḥ || 250
https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 51 Having offered worship he whose own glory was secure muttered repetitions of Vedic texts to Svayambhū for the safety of his son and performed various ceremonies hard to be accomplished like the god Ka in the first aeon wishing to create living beings,svāyaṁbhuvaṁ cārcikamarcayitvā jajāpa putrasthitaye sthitaśrīḥ |cakāra karmāṇi ca duṣkarāṇi prajāḥ sisṛkṣuḥ ka ivādikāle || 251
https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 52 He laid aside weapons and pondered the Śāstra he practised perfect calm and underwent various observances like a hermit he refused all objects of sense he viewed all his kingdoms 21 like a father,tatjyāja śastraṁ vimamarśa śāstraṁ śamaṁ siṣeve niyamaṁ viṣehe |vaśīva kaṁcidviṣayaṁ na bheje piteva sarvānviṣayān dadarśa || 252
https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 53 He endured the kingdom for the sake of his son his son for his family his family for fame fame for heaven heaven for the soul — he only desired the soul’s continuance for the sake of duty,babhāra rājyaṁ sa hi putrahetoḥ putraṁ kulārthaṁ yaśase kulaṁ tu |svargāya śabdaṁ divamātmahetordharmārthamātmasthitimācakāṁkṣa || 253
https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 54 Thus did he practise the various observances as followed by the pious and established from revelation he asking himself now that he has seen the face of his son how may my son be stopped from going to the forest’,evaṁ sa dharmaṁ vividhaṁ cakāra sadbhirnipātaṁ śrutitaśca siddham |dṛṣṭvā kathaṁ putramukhaṁ suto me vanaṁ na yāyāditi nāthamānaḥ || 254
https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, 55 The prudent 22 kings of the earth who wish to guard their prosperity watch over their sons in the world but this king though loving religion kept his son from religion and set him free towards all objects of pleasure,rirakṣiṣaṁtaḥ śriyamātmasaṁsthā rakṣaṁti putrān bhuvi bhūmipālāḥ |putraṁ nareṁdraḥ sa tu dharmakāmo rarakṣa dharmādviṣayeṣvamuṁcat || 255

https//bitly/2vG8Nwt, But all Bodhisattvas those beings of pre-eminent nature after knowing the flavour of worldly enjoyments have departed to the forest as soon as a son is born to them therefore he too though he had accomplished all his previous destiny even when the (final) motive had begun to germinate still went on pursuing worldly pleasure up to the time of attaining the supreme wisdom,ata upacitakarmā rūḍhamūle pi hetausa ratimupasiṣeve bodhimāpannayāvat || 256
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 1 On a certain day he heard of the forests carpeted with tender grass with their trees resounding with the kokilas adorned with lotus-ponds and which had been all bound up in the cold season,tataḥ kadācinmṛduśādvalāni puṁskokilonnāditapādapāni |śuśrāva padmākaramaṁḍitāni śīte nibaddhāni sa kānanāni || 31
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 2 Having heard of the delightful appearance of the city groves beloved by the women he resolved to go out of doors like an elephant long shut up in a house,śrutvā tataḥ strījanavallabhānāṁ manojñabhāvaṁ purakānanānām |bahiḥprayāṇāya cakāra buddhimaṁtargṛhe nāga ivāvaruddhaḥ || 32
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 3 The king having learned the character of the wish thus expressed by his son ordered a pleasure-party to be prepared worthy of his own affection and his son’s beauty and youth,tato nṛpastasya niśamya bhāvaṁ putrābhidhānasya manorathasya |snehasya lakṣmyā vayasaśca yogyām-ājñāpayāmāsa vihārayātrām || 33
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 4 He prohibited the encounter of any afflicted common person in the highroad heaven forbid that the prince with his tender nature should even imagine himself to be distressed’,nivartayāmāsa ca rājamārge saṁpātamārtasya pṛthagjanasya |mā bhūtkumāraḥ sukumāracittaḥ saṁvignacetā iva manyamānaḥ || 34
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 5 Then having removed out of the way with the greatest gentleness all those who had mutilated limbs or maimed senses the decrepit and the sick and all squalid beggars they made the highway assume its perfect beauty,pratyaṁgahīnān vikaleṁdriyāṁśca jīrṇāturādīn kṛpaṇāṁśca bhikṣūn |tataḥ samutsārya pareṇa sāmnā śobhāṁ parā rājapathasya cakruḥ || 35
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 6 Along this road thus made beautiful the fortunate prince with his well-trained attendants came down one day at a proper time from the roof of the palace and went to visit the king by his leave,tataḥ kṛte śrīmati rājamārge śrīmān vinītānucaraḥ kumāraḥ |prāsādapṛṣṭhādavatīrya kāle kṛtābhyanujño nṛpamabhyagacchat || 36
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 7 Then the king with tears rising to his eyes having smelt his son’s head 01 and long gazed upon him gave him his permission saying Go’ but in his heart through affection he could not let him depart,atho nareṁdraḥ sutamāgatāśruḥ śirasyupāghrāya ciraṁ nirīkṣya |gaccheti cājñāpayati sma vācā snehānna cainaṁ manasā mumoca || 37
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 8 He then mounted a golden chariot adorned with reins bright like flashing lightning 02 and yoked with four gentle horses all wearing golden trappings,tataḥ sa jāṁbūnadabhāṁḍabhṛdbhiryuktaṁ caturbhirnibhṛtaisturaṁgaiḥ |aklīvavidhyucchuciraśmidhārāṁ hiraṇmayaṁ syaṁdanamāruroha || 38
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 9 With a worthy retinue he entered the road which was strewn with heaps of gleaming flowers with garlands suspended and banners waving like the moon with its asterism entering the sky,tataḥ prakīrṇojjvalapuṣpajālaṁ viṣaktamālyaṁ pracalatpatākam |mārgaṁ prapede sadṛśānuyātraścaṁdraḥ sanakṣatra ivāntarīkṣam || 39
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 10 Slowly slowly he passed along the highway watched on every side by the citizens and beshowered by their eyes opened wide with curiosity like blue lotuses,kautūhalātsphītataraiśca netrairnīlotpalābhairiva kīryamāṇaḥ |śanaiḥ śanai rājapathaṁ jagāhe pauraiḥ samaṁtādabhivīkṣyamāṇaḥ || 310
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 11 Some praised him for his gentle disposition others hailed him for his glorious appearance others eulogised his beauty from his fine countenance and desired for him length of days,taṁ tuṣṭuvuḥ saumyaguṇena kecidvavaṁdire dīptatayā tathānye |saumukhyatastu śriyamasya kecidvaipulyamāśaṁsiṣurāyuṣaśca || 311
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 12 Hump-backed men coming out from the great families and troops of foresters and dwarfs 03 and women coming out from the meaner houses bowed down like the banners of some procession of the gods,niḥsṛtya kubjāśca mahākulebhyo vyūhāśca kairātakavāmanānām |nāryaḥ kṛśebhyaśca niveśanebhyo devānuyānadhvajavat praṇemuḥ || 312
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 13 04Hearing the news the prince is going out’ from the attendants of the female apartments the women hastened to the roofs of the different mansions having obtained the leave of their lords,tataḥ kumāraḥ khalu gacchatīti śrutvā striyaḥ preṣyajanātpravṛttim |didṛkṣayā harmyatalāni jagmurjanena mānyena kṛtābhyanujñāḥ || 313
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 14 Hindered by the strings of their girdles which had slipped down with their eyes bewildered as just awakened from sleep and with their ornaments hastily put on in the stir of the news and filled with curiosity they crowded round,tāḥ srastakāṁcīguṇavighnitāśca suptaprabuddhākulalocanāśca |vṛttāṁtavinyastavibhūṣaṇāśca kautūhalenāpi bhṛtāḥ parīyuḥ || 314
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 15 Frightening the flocks of birds which lived in the houses with the noise of their girdles and the jingling of their anklets which resounded on the staircases and roofs of the mansions and mutually reproaching one another for their hurry,prāsādasopānatalapraṇādaiḥ kāṁcīravairnūpuranisvanaiśca |vibhrāmayaṁtyo gṛhapakṣisaṁghānanyonyavegāṁśca samākṣipaṁtyaḥ || 315
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 16 Some of these women even in their haste as they rushed longing to see were delayed in their going by the weight of their hips and full bosoms,kāsāṁcidāsāṁ tu varāṁganānāṁ jātatvarāṇāmapi sotsukānām |gatiṁ gurutvājjagṛhurviśālāḥ śroṇīrathāḥ pīnapayodharāśca || 316
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 17 Another though well able to go herself checked her pace and forbore to run hiding with shame her ornaments hitherto worn only in seclusion and now too boldly displayed,śīghraṁ samarthāpi tu gaṁtumanyā gatiṁ nijagrāha yayau na tūrṇam |hriyā pragalbhāni nigūhamānā rahaḥ prayuktāni vibhūṣaṇāni || 317
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 18 There they were restlessly swaying about in the windows crowded together in the mutual press with their earrings polished by the continual collision and their ornaments all jingling,parasparotpīḍanapiṁḍitānāṁ saṁmardasaṁśobhitakuṁḍalānām |tāsāṁ tadā sasvanabhūṣaṇānāṁ vātāyaneṣvapraśamo babhūva || 318
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 19 The lotus-like faces of the women gleamed while they looked out from the windows with their earrings coming into mutual proximity 05 as if they were real lotuses fastened upon the houses,vātāyanebhyastu viniḥsṛtāni parasparopāsitakuṁḍalāni |strīṇāṁ virejurmukhapaṁkajāni saktāni harmyeṣviva paṁkajāni || 319
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 20 With the palaces all alive with crowds of damsels every aperture thrown open in eager curiosity the magnificent city appeared on every side like heaven with its divine chariots thronged with celestial nymphs,tato vimānairyuvatīkalāpaiḥ kautūhalodghāṭitavātayānaiḥ |śrīmatsamaṁtānnagaraṁ babhāse viyadvimānairiva sāpsarobhiḥ || 320
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 21 The faces of the beautiful women shone like lotuses wreathed in garlands while through the narrowness of the windows their earrings were transferred to each other’s cheeks,vātāyanānāmaviśālabhāvādanyonyagaṁḍārpitakuṁḍalāni |mukhāni rejuḥ pramadottamānāṁ baddhāḥ kalāpa iva paṁkajānām || 321
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 22 Gazing down upon the prince in the road the women appeared as if longing to fall to the earth gazing up to him with upturned faces the men seemed as if longing to rise to heaven 06,tasmin kumāraṁ pathi vīkṣamāṇāḥ striyo babhurgāmiva gaṁtukāmāḥ |ūrdhvonmukhāścainamudīkṣamāṇā narā babhurdyāmiva gaṁtukāmāḥ || 322
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 23 Beholding the king’s son thus radiant in his beauty and glory those women softly whispered happy is his wife’ with pure minds and from no baser feeling,dṛṣṭvā ca taṁ rājasutaṁ striyastā jājvalyamānaṁ vapuṣā śriyā ca |dhanyāsya bhāryeti śanairavocañśuddhairmanobhiḥ khalu nānyabhāvāt || 323
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 24 He with the long sturdy arms who stands in his beauty like the flower-armed god visibly present will leave his royal pomp and devote himself to religion’ thus thinking full of kindly feelings towards him they all offered reverence,ayaṁ kila vyāyatapīnabāhū rūpeṇa sākṣādiva puṣpaketuḥ |tyaktvā śriyaṁ dharmamupeṣyatīti tasmin hitā gauravameva cakruḥ || 324
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 25 Beholding for the first time that high-road thus crowded with respectful citizens all dressed in white sedate garments the prince for a while did feel a little pleasure and thought that it seemed to promise a revival of his youth,kīrṇaṁ tathā rājapathaṁ kumāraḥ paurairvinītaiḥ śucidhīraveṣaiḥ |tatpūrvamālokya jaharṣa kiṁcinmene punarbhāvamivātmanaśca || 325
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 26 But then the gods dwelling in pure abodes 07 having beheld that city thus rejoicing like heaven itself created an old man to walk along on purpose to stir the heart of the king’s son,puraṁ tu tatsvargamiva prahṛṣṭaṁ śuddhādhivāsāḥ samavekṣya devāḥ |jīrṇaṁ naraṁ nirmamire prayātuṁ saṁcodanārthaṁ kṣitipātmajasya || 326
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 27 The prince having beheld him thus overcome with decrepitude and different in form from other men with his gaze intently fixed on him thus addressed his driver 08 with simple confidence,tataḥ kumāro jarayābhibhūtaṁ dṛṣṭvā narebhyaḥ pṛthagākṛtiṁ tam |uvāca saṁgrāhakamāgatāsthastatraiva niṣkampaniviṣṭadṛṣṭiḥ || 327
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 28 Who is this man that has come here O charioteer with white hair and his hand resting on a staff his eyes hidden beneath his brows his limbs bent down and hanging loose — is this a change produced in him or his natural state or an accident’,ka eṣa bhoḥ sūta naro bhyupetaḥ keśaiḥ sitairyaṣṭiviṣaktahastaḥ |bhrūsaṁvṛtākṣaḥ śithilānatāṁgaḥ kiṁ vikriyaiṣā prakṛtiryadṛcchā || 328
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 29 Thus addressed the charioteer revealed to the king’s son the secret that should have been kept so carefully thinking no harm in his simplicity for those same gods had bewildered his mind,ityevamuktaḥ sa rathapraṇetā nivedayāmāsa nṛpātmajāya |saṁrakṣyamapyarthamadoṣadarśī taireva devaiḥ kṛtabuddhimohaḥ || 329
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 30 That is old age by which he is broken down — the ravisher of beauty the ruin of vigour the cause of sorrow the destruction of delights the bane of memories the enemy of the senses,rūpasya hartrī vyasanaṁ balasya śokasya yonirnidhanaṁ ratīnām |nāśaḥ smṛtīnāṁ ripuriṁdriyāṇāmeṣā jarā nāma yayaiṣa bhagnaḥ || 330
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 31 He too once drank milk in his childhood and in course of time he learned to grope on the ground having step by step become a vigorous youth he has step by step in the same way reached old age’,pītaṁ hyanenāpi payaḥ śiśutve kālena bhūyaḥ parimṛṣṭamurvyām |krameṇa bhūtvā ca yuvā vapuṣmān krameṇa tenaiva jarāmupetaḥ || 331
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 32 Being thus addressed the prince starting a little spoke these words to the charioteer What will this evil come to me also’ and to him again spoke the charioteer,ityevamukte calitaḥ sa kiṁcidrājātmajaḥ sūtamidaṁ babhāṣe |kimeṣa doṣo bhavitā mamāpītyasmai tataḥ sārathirabhyuvāca || 332
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 33 It will come without doubt by the force of time through multitude of years even to my long-lived lord all the world knows thus that old age will destroy their comeliness and they are content to have it so’,āyuṣmato pyeṣa vayaḥprakarṣānniḥsaṁśayaṁ kālavaśena bhāvī |evaṁ jarāṁ rūpavināśayitrīṁ jānāti caivecchati caiṣa lokaḥ || 333
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 34 Then he the great-souled one who had his mind purified by the impressions of former good actions who possessed a store of merits accumulated through many preceding aeons was deeply agitated when he heard of old age like a bull who has heard the crash of a thunderbolt close by,tataḥ sa pūrvāśayaśuddhabuddhirvistīrṇakalpācitapuṇyakarmā |śrutvā jarāṁ saṁvivije mahātmā mahāśanerghoṣamivāṁtike gauḥ || 334
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 35 Drawing a long sigh and shaking his head and fixing his eyes on that decrepit old man and looking round on that exultant multitude he then uttered these distressed words,niḥśvasya dīrghaṁ sa śiraḥ prakaṁpya tasmiṁśca jīrṇe viniveśya cakṣuḥ |tāṁ caiva dṛṣṭvā janatāṁ saharṣāṁ vākyaṁ sa saṁvignamidaṁ jagāda || 335
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 36 Old age thus strikes down all alike our memory comeliness and valour and yet the world is not disturbed even when it sees such a fate visibly impending,evaṁ jarā haṁti ca nirviśeṣaṁ smṛtiṁ ca rūpaṁ ca parākramaṁ ca |na caiva saṁvegamupaiti lokaḥ pratyakṣato pīdṛśamīkṣamāṇaḥ || 336
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 37 Since such is our condition O charioteer turn back the horses — go quickly home how can I rejoice in the pleasure-garden when the thoughts arising from old age overpower me’,evaṁ gate sūta nivartayāśvān śīghraṁ gṛhāṇyeva bhavānprayātu |udyānabhūmau hi kuto ratirme jarābhave cetasi vartamāne || 337
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 38 Then the charioteer at the command of the king’s son turned the chariot back and the prince lost in thought entered even that royal palace as if it were empty,athājñayā bhartṛsutasya tasya nivartayāmāsa rathaṁ niyaṁtā |tataḥ kumāro bhavanaṁ tadeva ciṁtāvaśaḥ śūnyamiva prapede || 338
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 39 But when he found no happiness even there as he continually kept reflecting old age old age’ then once more with the permission of the king he went out with the same arrangement as before,yadā tu tatraiva na śarma lebhe jarā jareti praparīkṣamāṇaḥ |tato nareṁdrānumataḥ sa bhūyaḥ krameṇa tenaiva bahirjagāma || 339
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 40 Then the same deities created another man with his body all afflicted by disease and on seeing him the son of Śuddhodana addressed the charioteer having his gaze fixed on the man,athāparaṁ vyādhiparītadehaṁ ta eva devāḥ sasṛjurmanuṣyam |dṛṣṭvā ca taṁ sārathimābabhāṣe śauddhodanistadgatadṛṣṭireva || 340
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 41 Yonder man with a swollen belly his whole frame shaking as he pants his arms and shoulders hanging loose his body all pale and thin uttering plaintively the word mother when he embraces a stranger — who pray is this’,sthūlodaraḥ śvāsacalaccharīraḥ srastāṁsabāhuḥ kṛśapāṇdugātraḥ |aṁbeti vācaṁ karuṇaṁ bruvāṇaḥ paraṁ samāśliṣya naraḥ ka eṣaḥ || 341
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 42 Then his charioteer answered Gentle Sir it is a very great affliction called sickness that has grown up caused by the inflammation of the (three) humours which has made even this strong man 09 no longer master of himself’,tato bravītsārathirasya saumya dhātuprakopaprabhavaḥ pravṛddhaḥ |rogābhidhānaḥ sumahānanarthaḥ śakro pi yenaiṣa kṛto svataṁtraḥ || 342
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 43 Then the prince again addressed him looking upon the man compassionately Is this evil peculiar to him or are all beings alike threatened by sickness’,ityūcivān rājasutaḥ sa bhūyastaṁ sānukaṁpo naramīkṣamāṇaḥ |asyaiva jātaḥ pṛthageṣa doṣaḥ sāmānyato rogabhayaṁ prajānām || 343
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 44 Then the charioteer answered O prince this evil is common to all thus pressed round by diseases men run to pleasure though racked with pain’ 10,tato babhāṣe sa rathapraṇetā kumāra sādhāraṇa eṣa doṣaḥ |evaṁ hi rogaiḥ paripīḍyamāno rujāturo harṣamupaiti lokaḥ || 344
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 45 Having heard this account his mind deeply distressed he trembled like the moon reflected in the waves of water and full of sorrow he uttered these words in a low voice,iti śrutārthaḥ sa viṣaṇṇacetāḥ prāvepatāṁbūrmigataḥ śaśīva |idaṁ ca vākyaṁ karuṇāyamānaḥ provāca kiṁcinmṛdunā svareṇa || 345
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 46 Even while they see all this calamity of diseases mankind can yet feel tranquillity alas for the scattered intelligence of men who can smile when still not free from the terrors of disease,idaṁ ca rogavyasanaṁ prajānāṁ paśyaṁśca viśraṁbhamupaiti lokaḥ |vistīrṇavijñānamaho narāṇāṁ hasaṁti ye rogabhayairamuktāḥ || 346
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 47 Let the chariot O charioteer be turned back from going outside let it return straight to the king’s palace having heard this alarm of disease my mind shrinks into itself repelled from pleasures’,nivartyatāṁ sūta vahiḥprayāṇānnareṁdrasadmaiva rathaḥ prayātu |śrutvā ca me rogabhayaṁ ratibhyaḥ pratyāhataṁ saṁkucatīva cetaḥ || 347
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 48 Then having turned back with all joy departed he entered his home absorbed in thought and having seen him thus return a second time the king himself entered the city,tato nivṛttaḥ sa nivṛttaharṣaḥ pradhyānayuktaḥ praviveśa sadma |taṁ dvistathā prekṣya ca saṁnivṛttaṁ puryāgamaṁ bhūmipatiścakāra || 348
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 49 Having heard the occasion of the prince’s return he felt himself as deserted by him and although unused to severe punishment even when displeased he rebuked him whose duty it was to see that the road was clear,śrutvā nimittaṁ tu nivartanasya saṁtyaktamātmānamanena mene |mārgasya śaucādhikṛtāya caiva cukrośa ruṣṭo pi ca nogradaṁḍaḥ || 349
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 50 And once more he arranged for his son all kinds of worldly enjoyments to their highest point imploring in his heart Would that he might not be able to forsake us even though rendered unable only through the restlessness of his senses’ 11,bhūyaśca tasmai vidadhe sutāya viśeṣayuktaṁ viṣayaprakāram |caleṁdriyatvādapi nāpi śakto nāsmānvijahyāditi nāthamānaḥ || 350
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 51 But when in the women’s apartments his son found no pleasure in the several objects of the senses sweet sounds and the rest he gave orders for another progress outside thinking to himself 12 It may create a diversion of sentiment’ 13,yadā ca śabdādibhiriṁdriyārthairaṁtaḥpure naiva suto sya reme |tato vahirvyādiśati sma yātrāṁ rasāntaraṁ syāditi manyamānaḥ || 351
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 52 And in his affection pondering on the condition of his son never thinking of any ills that might come from his haste he ordered the best singing-women to be in attendance as well-skilled in all the soft arts that can please,snehācca bhāvaṁ tanayasya buddhvā saṁvegadoṣānaviciṁtya kāṁścit |yogyāḥ samājñāpayati sma tatra kalāsvabhijña iti vāramukhyāḥ || 352
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 53 Then the royal road being specially adorned and guarded the king once more made the prince go out having ordered the charioteer and chariot to proceed in a contrary direction (to the previous one),tato viśeṣeṇa nareṁdramārge svalaṁkṛte caiva parīkṣite ca |vyatyāsya sūtaṁ ca rathaṁ ca rājā prasthāpayāmāsa bahiḥ kumāram || 353
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 54 But as the king’s son was thus going on his way the very same deities created a dead man and only the charioteer and the prince and none else beheld him as he was carried dead along the road,tatastathā gacchati rājaputre taireva devairvihito gatāsuḥ |taṁ caiva mārge mṛtamuhyamānaṁ sūtaḥ kumāraśca dadarśa nānyaḥ || 354
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 55 Then spoke the prince to the charioteer Who is this borne by four men followed by mournful companions who is bewailed adorned but no longer breathing’ 14,athābravīdrājasutaḥ sa sūtaṁ naraiścaturbhirhriyate ka eṣaḥ |dīnairmanuṣyairanugamyamāno yo bhūṣito śvāsyavarudyate ca || 355
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 56 Then the driver — having his mind overpowered by the gods who possess pure minds and pure dwellings — himself knowing the truth uttered to his lord this truth also which was not to be told,tataḥ sa śuddhātmabhireva devaiḥ śuddhādhivāsairabhibhūtacetāḥ |avācyamapyarthamimaṁ niyaṁtā pravyājahārārthavidīśvarāya || 356
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 57 This is some poor man who bereft of his intellect senses vital airs and qualities lying asleep and unconscious like mere wood or straw is abandoned alike by friends and enemies after they have carefully swathed and guarded him’,buddhīṁdriyaprāṇaguṇairviyuktaḥ supto visaṁjñastṛṇakāṣṭhabhūtaḥ |saṁbadhya saṁrakṣya ca yatnavadbhiḥ priyāpriyaistyajyata eṣa ko pi || 357
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 58 Having heard these words of the charioteer he was somewhat startled and said to him Is this an accident peculiar to him alone or is such the end of all living creatures’,iti praṇetuḥ sa niśamya vākyaṁ saṁcukṣubhe kiṁciduvāca cainam |kiṁ kevalasyaiva janasya dharmaḥ sarvaprajānāmayamīdṛśo ṁtaḥ || 358
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 59 Then the charioteer replied to him This is the final end of all living creatures be it a mean man a man of middle state or a noble destruction is fixed to all in this world’,tataḥ praṇetā vadati sma tasmai sarvaprajānāmayamaṁtakarmā |hīnasya madhyasya mahātmano vā sarvasya loke niyato vināśaḥ || 359
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 60 Then the king’s son sedate though he was as soon as he heard of death immediately sank down overwhelmed and pressing the end of the chariotpole with his shoulder spoke with a loud voice,tataḥ sa dhīro pi nareṁdrasūnuḥ śrutvaiva mṛtyuṁ viṣasāda sadyaḥ |aṁsena saṁśliṣya ca kūbarāgraṁ provāca nihrādavatā svareṇa || 360
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 61 Is this end appointed to all creatures and yet the world throws off all fear and is infatuated Hard indeed I think must the hearts of men be who can be self-composed in such a road,iyaṁ ca niṣṭhā niyataṁ prajānāṁ pramādyati tyaktabhayaśca lokaḥ |manāṁsi śaṁke kaṭhināni n�oṇāṁ svasthāstathā hyadhvani vartamānāḥ || 361
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 62 Therefore O charioteer turn back our chariot this is no time or place for a pleasure-excursion how can a rational being who knows what destruction is stay heedless here in the hour of calamity’ 15,tasmādrathaṁ sūta nivartyatāṁ no vihārabhūmau na hi deśakālaḥ |jānanvināśaṁ kathamārttikāle sacetanaḥ syādiha hi pramattaḥ || 362
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 63 Even when the prince thus spoke to him the charioteer did not turn the chariot back but at his peremptorily reiterated command he retired to the forest Padmakhaṇḍa,iti bruvāṇe pi narādhipātmaje nivartayāmāsa sa naiva taṁ ratham |viśeṣayuktaṁ tu nareṁdraśāsanātsa padmakhaṁḍaṁ vanameva niryayau || 363
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 64 There he beheld that lovely forest like Nandana itself full of young trees in flower with intoxicated kokilas wandering joyously about and with its bright lakes gay with lotuses and well-furnished with watering-places 16,tataḥ śivaṁ kusumitabālapādapaṁ paribhramatpramuditamattakokilam |vipānavatsakamalacārudīrghikaṁ dadarśa tadvanamiva naṁdanaṁ vanam || 364
https//bitly/2iglXgu, 65 The king’s son was perforce carried away to that wood filled with troops of beautiful women just as if some devotee who had newly taken his vow were carried off feeling weak to withstand temptation to the palace of the monarch of Alakā 17 gay with the dancing of the loveliest heavenly nymphs,varāṁganāgaṇakalilaṁ nṛpātmajastato balādvanamabhinīyate sma tat |varāpsaronṛtyamalakādhipālayaṁ navavrato muniriva vighnakātaraḥ || 365
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 1 Then from that city-garden with their eyes restless in excitement the women went out to meet the prince as a newly-arrived bridegroom,tatastasmāt purodyānāt kautūhalacalekṣaṇāḥ |pratyujjagmurnṛpasutaṁ prāptaṁ varamiva striyaḥ || 41
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 2 And when they came up to him their eyes wide open in wonder they performed their due homage with hands folded like a lotus-caly,xabhigamya ca tāstasmai vismayotphullalocanāḥ |cakrire samudācāraṁ padmakośanibhaiḥ karaiḥ || 42
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 3 Then they stood surrounding him their minds overpowered by passion as if they were drinking him in with their eyes motionless and blossoming wide with love,tasthuśca parivāryainaṁ manmathākṣiptacetasaḥ |niścalaiḥ prītivikacaiḥ pibaṁtya iva locanaiḥ || 43
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 4 Some of the women verily thought that he was Kāma incarnate — decorated as he was with his brilliant signs as with connate ornaments,taṁ hi tā menire nāryaḥ kāmo vigrahavāniti |śobhitaṁ lakṣaṇairdīptaiḥ sahajairbhūṣaṇairiva || 44
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 5 Others thought from his gentleness and majesty that it was the moon with its ambrosial beams as it were visibly come down to the earth,saumyatvāccaiva dhairyācca kāścidenaṁ prajajñire |avatīrṇo mahīṁ sākṣād sudhāṁśuścaṁdramā iva || 45
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 6 Others smitten by his beauty yawned 01 as if to swallow him and fixing their eyes on each other softly sighed,tasya tā vapuṣākṣiptā nirgrahītuṁ jajṛṁbhire |anyonyaṁ dṛṣṭibhirgatvā śanaiśca viniśaśvasuḥ || 46
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 7 Thus the women only looked upon him simply gazing with their eyes — they spoke not nor did they smile controlled by his power,evaṁ tā dṛṣṭimātreṇa nāryo dadṛśureva tam |na vyājahrurna jahasuḥ prabhāveṇāsya yaṁtritāḥ || 47
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 8 But having seen them thus listless bewildered in their love the wise son of the family priest Udāyin thus addressed them,tāstathā tu nirāraṁbhā dṛṣṭvā praṇayaviklavāḥ |purohitasuto dhīmānudāyī vākyamabravīt || 48
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 9 Ye are all skilled in all the graceful arts proficients in understanding the language of amorous sentiments possessed of beauty and gracefulness thorough masters in your own styles,sarvāḥ sarvakalājñāḥ stha bhāvagrahaṇapaṁḍitāḥ |rūpacāturyasaṁpannāḥ svaguṇairmukhyatāṁ gatāḥ || 49
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 10 With these graces of yours ye may embellish even the Northern Kurus yea even the dances 02 of Kuvera much more this little earth,śobhayata guṇairebhirapi tānuttarān kurūn |kuverasyāpi ca krīḍaṁ prāgeva vasudhāmimām || 410
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 11 Ye are able to move even sages who have lost all their desires and to ensnare even the gods who are charmed by heavenly nymphs,śaktāścālayituṁ yūyaṁ vītarāgānṛṣīnapi |apsarobhiśca kalitān grahītuṁ vibudhānapi || 411
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 12 By your skill in expressing the heart’s feelings by your coquetry your grace and your perfect beauty ye are able to enrapture even women how much more easily men,bhāvajñānena hāvena cāturyādrūpasaṁpadā |strīṇāmeva ca śaktāḥ stha saṁrāge kiṁ punarnṛṇām || 412
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 13 You thus skilled as ye are each set 03 in her own proper sphere — such as this is your power I am not satisfied with your simplicity ,tāsāmevaṁvidhānāṁ vo niyuktānāṁ svagocare |iyamevaṁvidhā ceṣṭā na tuṣṭo smyārjavena vaḥ || 413
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 14 This timid action of yours would be fit for new brides their eyes closed through shame — or it might be a blandishment worthy even of the wives of the cowherds 04,idaṁ navavadhūnāṁ vo hrīnikuṁcitacakṣuṣām |sadṛśaṁ ceṣṭitaṁ hi syādapi vā gopayoṣitām || 414
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 15 What though this hero be great by his exalted glory yet great is the might of women let this be your firm resolve,yadyapi syādayaṁ vīraḥ śrīprabhāvānmahāniti |strīṇāmapi mahatteja iti kāryo tra niścayaḥ || 415
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 16 In olden time a great seer hard to be conquered even by the gods was spurned by a harlot the beauty of Kāśi planting her feet upon him,purā hi kāśisuṁdaryā veśavadhvā mahānṛṣiḥ |tāḍito bhūt padanyāsāddurdharṣo daivatairapi || 416
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 17 The Bhikṣu Manthālagautama was also formerly spurned by Bālamukhyā with her leg and wishing to please her he carried out dead bodies for her sake to be buried,maṁthālagautamo bhikṣurjaṁghayā bālamukhyayā |piprīṣuśca tadarthārthaṁ vyasūn niraharat purā || 417
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 18 And a woman low in standing and caste fascinated the great seer Gautama though a master of long penances and old in years,gautamaṁ dīrghatapasaṁ mahārṣiṁ dīrghajīvinam |yoṣit saṁtoṣayāmāsa varṇasthānāvarā satī || 418
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 19 So Śāntā 05 by her various wiles captivated and subdued the sage’s son Ṛṣyaśṛṅga unskilled in women’s ways,ṛṣyaśṛṁgaṁ munisutaṁ tathaiva strīṣvapaṁḍitam |upāyairvividhaiḥ śāṁtā jagrāha ca jahāra ca || 419
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 20 And the great seer Viśvāmitra though plunged in a profound penance 06 was carried captive for ten years in the forests by the nymph Ghṛtācī 07,viśvāmitro maharṣiśca vigāḍho pi mahattapāḥ |daśavarṣāṇyaraṇyastho ghṛtācyāpsarasā hṛtaḥ || 420
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 21 Many such seers as these have women brought to shame — how much more then a delicate prince in the first flower of his age,evamādīnṛṣīṁstāṁstānanayan vikriyāṁ striyaḥ |lalitaṁ pūrvavayasaṁ kiṁ punarnṛpateḥ sutam || 421
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 22 This being so boldly put forth your efforts that the prosperity of the king’s family may not be turned away from him,tadevaṁ sati viśrabdhaṁ prayatadhvaṁ tathā yathā |iyaṁ nṛpasya vaṁśaśrīrito na syātparāṅmukhī || 422
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 23 Ordinary women captivate similar lovers but they are truly women who subdue the natures of high and low’,yā hi kāścidyuvatayo haraṁti sadṛśaṁ janam |nikṛṣṭotkṛṣṭayorbhāvaṁ yā gṛhṇaṁti tu tāḥ striyaḥ || 423
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 24 Having heard these words of Udāyin these women as stung to the heart rose even above themselves for the conquest of the prince,ityudāyivacaḥ śrutvā tā viddhā iva yoṣitaḥ |samāruruhurātmānaṁ kumāragrahaṇaṁ prati || 424
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 25 With their brows their glances their coquetries their smiles their delicate movements they made all sorts of significant gestures like women utterly terrified,tā bhrūbhiḥ prekṣitairbhāvairhasitairlalitairgataiḥ |cakrurākṣepikāśceṣṭā bhītabhītā ivāṁganāḥ || 425
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 26 But they soon regained their confidence 08 through the command of the king and the gentle temperament of the prince and through the power of intoxication and of love,rājñastu viniyogena kumārasya ca mārdavāt |jahruḥ kṣipramaviśraṁbhaṁ madena madanena ca || 426
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 27 Then surrounded by troops of women the prince wandered in the wood like an elephant in the forests of Himavat accompanied by a herd of females,atha nārījanavṛtaḥ kumāro vyacaradvanam |vāsitāyūthasahitaḥ karīva himavadvanam || 427
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 28 Attended by the women he shone in that pleasant grove as the sun surrounded by Apsarasas in his royal garden,sa tasmin kānane ramye jajvāla strīpuraḥsaraḥ |ākrīḍa iva babhrāje vivasvānapsarovṛtaḥ || 428
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 29 There some of them urged by passion pressed him with their full firm bosoms in gentle collisions,madenāvarjitā nāma taṁ kāścittatra yoṣitaḥ |kaṭhinaiḥ paspṛśuḥ pīnaiḥ saṁghaṭṭairvalgubhiḥ stanaiḥ || 429
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 30 Another violently embraced him after making a pretended stumble — leaning on him with her shoulders drooping down and with her gentle creeper-like arms dependent,srastāṁsakomalālaṁbamṛdubāhulatābalā |anṛtaṁ skhalitaṁ kācitkṛtvainaṁ sasvaje balāt || 430
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 31 Another with her mouth smelling of spirituous liquor her lower lip red like copper whispered in his ear Let my secret be heard’,kācit tāmrādharoṣṭhena mukhenāsavagaṁdhinā |viniśaśvāsa karṇe sya rahasyaṁ śrūyatāmiti || 431
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 32 Another all wet with unguents as if giving him her command clasped his hand eagerly and said Perform thy rites of adoration here’,kācidājñāpayaṁtīva provācārdrānulepanā |iha bhaktiṁ kuruṣveti hastaṁ saṁśliṣya lipsayā || 432
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 33 Another with her blue garments continually slipping down in pretended intoxication stood conspicuous with her tongue visible like the night with its lightning flashing,muhurmuhurmadavyājasrastanīlāṁśukāparā |ālakṣyarasanā reje sphuradvidyudiva kṣapā || 433
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 34 Others with their golden zones tinkling wandered about here and there showing to him their hips veiled with thin cloth,kāścitkanakakāṁcībhirmukharābhiritastataḥ |babhramurdarśayaṁtyo sya śroṇīstanvaṁśukāvṛtāḥ || 434
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 35 Others leaned holding a mango-bough in full flower displaying their bosoms like golden jars,cūtaśākhāṁ kusumitāṁ pragṛhyānyā lalaṁbire |suvarṇakalaśaprakhyān darśayaṁtyaḥ payodharān || 435
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 36 Another coming from a lotus-bed carrying lotuses and with eyes like lotuses stood like the lotus-goddess Padmā by the side of that lotus-faced prince,kācitpadmavanādetya sapadmā padmalocanā |padmavaktrasya pārśve sya padmaśrīriva tasthuṣī || 436
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 37 Another sang a sweet song easily understood and with the proper gesticulations rousing him self-subdued though he was by her glances as saying O how thou art deluded’,madhuraṁ gītamanvarthaṁ kācitsābhinayaṁ jagau |taṁ svasthaṁ codayaṁtīva vaṁcito sītyavekṣitaiḥ || 437
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 38 Another having armed herself 09 with her bright face with its brow-bow drawn to its full imitated his action as playing the hero,śubhena vadanenānyā bhrūkārmukavikarṣiṇā |prāvṛtyānucakārāsya ceṣṭitaṁ vīralīlayā || 438
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 39 Another with beautiful full bosoms and having her earrings waving in the wind 10 laughed loudly at him as if saying Catch me sir if you can’,pīnavalgustanī kācidvātāghūrṇitakuṁḍalā |uccairavajahāsainaṁ samāpnotu bhavāniti || 439
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 40 Some as he was going away bound him with strings of garlands — others punished him with words like an elephant-driver’s hook gentle yet reproachful,apayāntaṁ tathaivānyā babaṁdhurmālyadāmabhiḥ |kāścitsākṣepamadhurairjagṛhurvacanāṁkuśaiḥ || 440
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 41 Another wishing to argue with him seizing a mango-spray asked all bewildered with passion This flower whose is it’,pratiyogārthinī kācidgṛhītvā cūtavallarīm |idaṁ puṣpaṁ tu kasyeti papraccha madaviklavā || 441
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 42 Another assuming a gait and attitude like those of a man said to him Thou who art conquered by women go and conquer this earth’,kācitpuruṣavatkṛtvā gatiṁ saṁsthānameva ca |uvācainaṁ jitaḥ strībhirjaya bhoḥ pṛthivīmimām || 442
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 43 Then another with rolling eyes smelling a blue lotus thus addressed the prince with words slightly indistinct in her excitement,atha loleksaṇā kācijjighraṁtī nīlamutpalam |kiṁcinmadakalairvākyairnṛpātmajamabhāṣata || 443
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 44 See my lord this mango covered with its honey-scented flowers where the kokila sings as if imprisoned in a golden cage,paśya bhartaścitaṁ cūtaṁ kusumairmadhugaṁdhibhiḥ |hemapaṁjararuddho vā kokilo yatra kūjati || 444
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 45 Come and see this aśoka tree which augments lovers’ sorrows — where the bees make a noise as if they were scorched by fire,aśoko dṛśyatāmeṣa kāmiśokavivardhanaḥ |ruvaṁti bhramarā yatra dahyamānā ivāgninā || 445
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 46 Come and see this tilaka tree embraced by a slender mango-branch like a man in a white garment by a woman decked with yellow unguents,cūtayaṣṭyā samāśliṣṭo dṛśyatāṁ tilakadrumaḥ |śuklavāsā iva naraḥ striyā pītāṁgarāgayā || 446
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 47 Behold this kuruvaka in flower bright like fresh 11 resin-juice which bends down as if it felt reproached by the colour of women’s nails 12,phullaṁ kuruvakaṁ paśya nirmuktālaktakaprabham |yo nakhaprabhayā strīṇāṁ nirbhartsita ivānataḥ || 447
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 48 Come and see this young aśoka covered all over with new shoots which stands as it were ashamed at the beauty of our hands,bālāśokaśca nicito dṛśyatāmeṣa pallavaiḥ |yo smākaṁ hastaśobhābhirlajjamāna iva sthitaḥ || 448
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 49 See this lake surrounded by the sinduvāra shrubs growing on its banks 13 like a fair woman reclining clad in fine white cloth,dīrghikāṁ prāvṛtāṁ paśya tīrajaiḥ siṁduvārakaiḥ |pāṁḍurāṁśukasaṁvītāṁ śayānāṁ pramadāmiva || 449
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 50 See the imperial power of females — yonder ruddy-goose in the water goes behind his mate following her like a slave,dṛśyatāṁ strīṣu māhātmyaṁ cakravāko hyasau jale |pṛṣṭhataḥ preṣyavadbhāryāmanuvṛtyānugacchati || 450
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 51 Come and listen to the notes of this intoxicated cuckoo as he sings while another cuckoo sings as if consenting wholly without care,mattasya parapuṣṭasya ruvataḥ śrūyatāṁ dhvaniḥ |aparaḥ kokilo nutkaḥ pratiśrutyeva kūjati || 451
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 52 Would that thine was the intoxication of the birds which the spring produces — and not the thought of a thinking man ever pondering how wise he is’,api nāma vihaṁgānāṁ vasaṁtenāhito madaḥ |na tu ciṁtayataścittaṁ janasya prājñamāninaḥ || 452
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 53 Thus these young women their souls carried away by love assailed the prince with all kinds of stratagems,ityevaṁ tā yuvatayo manmathoddāmacetasaḥ |kumāraṁ vividhaistaistairupacakramire nayaiḥ || 453
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 54 But although thus attacked he having his senses guarded by self-control neither rejoiced nor smiled thinking anxiously One must die’,evamākṣipyamāṇo pi sa tu dhairyāvṛteṁdriyaḥ |martavyamiti sodvego na jaharṣa na sismiye || 454
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 55 Having seen them in their real condition 14 that best of men pondered with an undisturbed 15 and stedfast mind,tāsāṁ tattvena vasthānaṁ dṛṣṭvā sa puruṣottamaḥ |sasaṁvignena dhīreṇa ciṁtayāmāsa cetasā || 455
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 56 What is it that these women lack 16 that they perceive not that youth is fickle for this old age will destroy whatever has beauty,kiṁ vinā nāvagacchaṁti capalaṁ yauvanaṁ striyaḥ |yato rūpeṇa saṁpannaṁ jareyaṁ nāśayiṣyati || 456
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 57 Verily they do not see any one’s plunge into disease and so dismissing fear they are joyous in a world which is all pain,nūnametā na paśyaṁti kasyacid rogasaṁplavam |tathā hṛṣṭā bhayaṁ tyaktvā jagati vyādhidharmiṇi || 457
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 58 Evidently they know nothing of death which carries all away and so at ease and without distress they can sport and laugh,anabhijñāśca suvyaktaṁ mṛtyoḥ sarvāpahāriṇaḥ |tathā svasthā nirudvegāḥ krīḍaṁti ca hasaṁti ca || 458
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 59 What rational being who knows of old age death and sickness could stand 17 or sit down at his ease or sleep far less laugh,jarāṁ mṛtyuṁ ca vyādhiṁ ca ko hi jānan sacetanaḥ |svasthastiṣṭhan niṣīdedvā supedvā kiṁ punarhaset || 459
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 60 But he verily is like one bereft of sense who beholding another aged or sick or dead remains self-possessed and not afflicted,yastu dṛṣṭvā paraṁ jīrṇaṁ vyādhitaṁ mṛtameva ca |svastho bhavati nodvigno yathācetāstathaiva saḥ || 460
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 61 ‘(So) even when a tree is deprived of its flowers and fruits or if it is cut down and falls no other tree sorrows’,viyujyamāne pi tarau puṣpairapi phalairapi |patati cchidyamāne vā taruranyo na śocate || 461
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 62 Seeing him thus absorbed in contemplation with his desires estranged from all worldly objects Udāyin well skilled in the rules of policy with kindly feelings addressed him,iti dhyānaparaṁ dṛṣṭvā viṣayebhyo gataspṛham |udāyī nītiśāstrajñastamuvāca suhṛttayā || 462
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 63 Since I was appointed by the king as a fitting friend for thee therefore I have a wish to speak to thee in this friendliness of my heart,ahaṁ nṛpatinā dattaḥ sakhā tubhyaṁ kṣamaḥ kila |yasmāttvayi vivakṣā me tayā praṇayavattayā || 463
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 64 To hinder from what is disadvantageous to urge to what is advantageous — and not to forsake in misfortune — these are the three marks of a friend,ahitāt pratiṣedhaśca hite cānupravartanam |vyasane cāparityāgastrividhaṁ mitralakṣaṇam || 464
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 65 If I after having promised my friendship were not to heed when thou turnest away from the great end of man there would be no friendship in me,so haṁ maitrīṁ pratijñāya puruṣārthātparāṅmukham |yadi tvāṁ samupekṣeyaṁ na bhavenmitratā mayi || 465
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 66 Therefore I speak as thy friend — such rudeness as this to women is not befitting for one young in years and graceful in person,tadbravīmi suhṛdbhūtvā taruṇasya vapuṣmataḥ |idaṁ na pratirūpaṁ te strīṣvadākṣiṇyamīdṛśam || 466
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 67 It is right to woo a woman even by guile this is useful both for getting rid of shame and for one’s own enjoyment,anṛtenāpi nārīṇāṁ yuktaṁ samanuvartanam |tadvrīḍāparihārārthamātmaratyarthameva ca || 467
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 68 Reverential behaviour and compliance with her wishes are what binds a woman’s heart good qualities truly are a cause of love and women love respect,saṁnatiscānuvṛttiśca strīṇāṁ hṛdayabaṁdhanam |snehasya hi guṇā yonirmānakāmāśca yoṣitaḥ || 468
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 69 Wilt thou not then O large-eyed prince even if thy heart is unwilling seek to please them with a courtesy worthy of this beauty of thine,tadarhasi viśālākṣa hṛdaye pi parāṅmukhe |rūpasyāsyānurūpeṇa dākṣiṇyenānuvartitum || 469
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 70 Courtesy is the balm of women courtesy is the best ornament beauty without courtesy is like a grove without flowers,dākṣiṇyamauṣadhaṁ strīṇāṁ dākṣiṇyaṁ bhūṣaṇaṁ param |dākṣiṇyarahitaṁ rūpaṁ niṣpuṣpamiva kānanam || 470
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 71 But of what use is courtesy by itself let it be assisted by the heart’s feelings surely when worldly objects so hard to attain are in thy grasp thou wilt not despise them,kiṁ vā dākṣiṇyamātreṇa bhāvenāstu parigrahaḥ |viṣayān durlabhāṁllabdhvā na hyavajñātumarhasi || 471
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 72 Knowing that pleasure was the best of objects even the god Puraṁdara (Indra) wooed in olden time Ahalyā the wife of the saint Gautama,kāmaṁ paramiti jñātvā devo pi hi puraṁdaraḥ |gautamasya muneḥ patnīmahalyāṁ cakame purā || 472
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 73 So too Agastya wooed Rohiṇī the wife of Soma and therefore as Śruti saith a like thing befell Lopāmudrā 18,agastyaḥ prārthayāmāsa somabhāryāṁ ca rohiṇīm |tasmāt tatsadṛśaṁ lebhe lopāmudrāmiti śrutiḥ || 473
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 74 The great ascetic Vṛhaspati begot Bharadvāja on Mamatā the daughter of the Maruts the wife of Autathya 19,autathyasya ca bhāryāyāṁ mamatāyāṁ mahātapāḥ |mārutyāṁ janayāmāsa bharadvājaṁ vṛhaspatiḥ || 474
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 75 The Moon the best of offerers begat Budha of divine nature on the spouse of Vṛhaspati as she was offering a libation 20,vṛhaspatermahiṣyāṁ ca juhvatyāṁ juhvatāṁ varaḥ |budhaṁ vibudhadharmāṇaṁ janayāmāsa caṁdramāḥ || 475
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 76 So too in old time Parāśara overpowered by passion on the bank of the Yamunā lay with the maiden Kālī who was the daughter of the son of the Water (Agni),kālīm caiva purā kanyāṁ jalaprabhavasaṁbhavām |jagāma yamunātīre jātarāgaḥ parāśaraḥ || 476
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 77 The sage Vaśiṣṭha through lust begot a son Kapiñjalāda on Akṣamālā a despised low-caste woman 21,mātaṁgyāmakṣamālāyāṁ garhitāyāṁ riraṁsayā |kapiṁjalādaṁ tanayaṁ vasiṣṭho janayanmuniḥ || 477
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 78 And the seer-king Yayāti even when the vigour of his prime was gone sported in the Caitraratha forest with the Apsaras Viśvācī,yayātiścaiva rājarṣirvayasyapi vinirgate |viśvācyāpsarasā sārdhaṁ reme caitrarathe vane || 478
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 79 And the Kaurava king Pāṇḍu though he knew that intercourse with his wife would end in death yet overcome by the beauty and good qualities of Mādrī yielded to the pleasures of love,strīsaṁsargaṁ vināśāṁtaṁ pāṁḍurjñātvāpi kauravaḥ |mādrīrūpaguṇākṣiptaḥ siṣeve kāmajaṁ sukham || 479
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 80 And so Karālajanaka when he carried off the Brāhman’s daughter incurred loss of caste thereby but he would not give up his love,karālajanakaścaiva hṛtvā brāhmaṇakanyakām |avāpa bhraṁśam apyeva na tu tyajecca manmatham || 480
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 81 Great heroes such as these pursued even contemptible desires for the sake of pleasure how much more so when they are praiseworthy of their kind,evamādyā mahātmāno viṣayān garhitānapi |ratihetorbubhujire prāgeva guṇasaṁhitān || 481
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 82 And yet thou a young man possessed of strength and beauty despisest enjoyments which rightly belong to thee and to which the whole world is devoted’,tvaṁ punarnyāyataḥ prāptān balavān rūpavān yuvā |viṣayānavajānāsi yatra saktamidaṁ jagat || 482
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 83 Having heard these specious words of his well-supported by sacred tradition the prince made reply in a voice like the thundering of a cloud,iti śrutvā vacastasya ślakṣṇamāgamasaṁhitam |meghastanitanirghoṣaḥ kumāraḥ pratyabhāṣata || 483
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 84 This speech manifesting affection is well-befitting in thee but I will convince thee as to where thou wrongly judgest me,upapannamidaṁ vākyaṁ sauhārdavyaṁjakaṁ tvayi |atra ca tvānuneṣyāmi yatra mā duṣṭhu manyase || 484
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 85 I do not despise worldly objects I know that all mankind are bound up therein but remembering that the world is transitory my mind cannot find pleasure in them,nāvajānāmi viṣayāñjāne lokaṁ tadātmakam |anityaṁ tu jaganmatvā nātra me ramate manaḥ || 485
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 86 Old age disease and death — if these three things did not exist I too should find my enjoyment in the objects that please the mind,jarā vyādhiśca mṛtyuśca yadi na syādidaṁ trayam |mamāpi hi manojñeṣu viṣayeṣu ratirbhavet || 486
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 87 Yet even though this beauty of women were to remain perpetual still delight in the pleasures of desire would not be worthy of the wise man,nityaṁ yadyapi hi strīṇāmetadeva vapurbhavet |sasaṁvitkasya kāmeṣu tathāpi na ratiḥ kṣamā || 487
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 88 But since their beauty will be drunk up by old age to delight therein through infatuation cannot be a thing approved even by thyself 22,yadā tu jarayā pītaṁ rūpamāsāṁ bhaviṣyati |ātmano pyanabhipretaṁ mohāttatra ratirbhavet || 488
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 89 He who himself subject to death disease and old age can sport undisturbed with those whose very nature implies death disease and old age such a man is on a level with birds and beasts,mṛtyuvyādhijarādharmo mṛtyuvyādhijarātmabhiḥ |ramamāṇo pyasaṁvignaḥ samāno mṛgapakṣibhiḥ || 489
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 90 And as for what thou sayest as to even those great men having become victims to desire do not be bewildered by them for destruction was also their lot,yadapyāttha mahātmānaste pi kāmātmakā iti |saṁvego tra na kartavyo yadā teṣāmapi kṣayaḥ || 490
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 91 Real greatness is not to be found there where there is universally destruction or where there is attachment to earthly objects or a want of self-control,māhātmyaṁ na ca tanmanye yatra sāmānyataḥ kṣayaḥ |viṣayeṣu prasaktirvā yuktirvā nātmavattayā || 491
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 92 And when thou sayest Let one deal with women even by guile I know nought about guile even if it be accompanied with courtesy,yadapyātthānṛtenāpi strījane vartyatāmiti |anṛtaṁ nāvagacchāmi dākṣiṇyenāpi kiṁcana || 492
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 93 That compliance too with a woman’s wishes pleases me not if truthfulness be not there if there be not a union with one’s whole soul and nature then out upon it say I,na cānuvartanaṁ tanme rucitaṁ yatra nārjavam |sarvabhāvena saṁparko yadi nāsti dhigastu tat || 493
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 94 A soul overpowered by passion believing in falsehood carried away by attachment and blind to the faults of its objects — what is there in it worth being deceived,anṛte śraddadhānasya saktasyādoṣadarśinaḥ |kiṁ hi vaṁcayitavyaṁ syājjātarāgasya cetasaḥ || 494
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 95 And if the victims of passion do deceive one another — are not men unfit for women to look at and women for men,vaṁcayaṁti ca yadyeva jātarāgāḥ parasparam |nanu naiva kṣamaṁ draṣṭuṁ narāḥ strīṇāṁ nṛṇām striyaḥ || 495
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 96 Since then these things are so thou surely wouldest not lead me astray into ignoble pleasures — me afflicted by sorrow and subject to old age and death,tadevaṁ sati duḥkhārttaṁ jarāmaraṇabhoginam |na māṁ kāmeṣvanāryeṣu pratārayitumarhasi || 496
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 97 Ah thy mind must be very firm and strong if thou canst find substance in the transitory pleasures of sense even in the midst of violent alarm thou canst cling to worldly objects when thou seest all created beings in the road of death,aho tidhīraṁ balavacca te manaścaleṣu kāmeṣu ca sāradarśinaḥ |bhaye pi tīvre viṣayeṣu sajjase nirīkṣamāṇo maraṇādhvani prajāḥ || 497
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 98 But I am fearful and exceedingly bewildered as I ponder the terrors of old age death and disease I can find no peace no self-command much less can I find pleasure while I see the world as it were ablaze with fire,ahaṁ punarbhīruratīvaviklavo jarāvipadvyādhibhayaṁ viciṁtayan |labhe na śāṁtiṁ na dhṛtiṁ kuto ratiṁ niśāmayan dīptamivāgninā jagat || 498
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 99 If desire arises in the heart of the man who knows that death is certain — I think that his soul must be made of iron who restrains it in this great terror and does not weep’,asaṁśayaṁ mṛtyuriti prajānato narasya rāgo hṛdi yasya jāyate |ayomayīṁ tasya paraimi cetanāṁ mahābhaye rakṣati yo na roditi || 499
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 100 Then the prince uttered a discourse full of resolve and abolishing the objects of desire and the lord of day whose orb is the worthy centre of human eyes departed to the Western Mountain,athau kumāraśca viniścayātmikāṁ cakāra kāmāśrayaghātinīṁ kathām |janasya cakṣurgamanīyamaṁḍalo mahīdharaṁ cāstamiyāya bhāskaraḥ || 4100
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 101 And the women having worn their garlands and ornaments in vain with their graceful arts and endearments all fruitless concealing their love deep in their hearts 23 returned to the city with broken hopes,tato vṛthādhāritabhūṣaṇasrajaḥ kalāguṇaiśca praṇayaiśca niṣphalaiḥ |sva eva bhāve vinigṛhya manmathaṁ puraṁ yayurbhagnamanorathāḥ striyaḥ || 4101
https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 102 Having thus seen the beauty 24 of the troop of women who had gone out to the city-garden now withdrawn in the evening — the prince pondering the transitoriness which envelopes all things entered his dwelling,tataḥ purodyānagatāṁ janaśriyaṁ nirīkṣya sāyaṁ pratisaṁhṛtāṁ punaḥ |anityatāṁ sarvagatāṁ viciṁtayan viveśa dhiṣṇyaṁ kṣitipālakātmajaḥ || 4102

https//bitly/2wg2fa4, 103 Then the king when he heard how his mind turned away from all objects of sense could not lie down all that night like an elephant with an arrow in its heart but wearied in all sorts of consultation he and his ministers could find no other means beside these (despised) pleasures to restrain his son’s purpose,atha śrāṁto maṁtre bahuvividhamārge sasacivona so nyatkāmebhyo niyamanamapaśyatsutamateḥ || 4103
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 1 He the son of the Śākya king even though thus tempted by the objects of sense which infatuate others yielded not to pleasure and felt not delight like a lion deeply pierced in his heart by a poisoned arrow,sa tathā viṣayairvilobhyamānaḥ paramohairapi śākyarājasūnuḥ |na jagāma ratiṁ na śarma lebhe hṛdaye siṁha ivātidigdhaviddhaḥ || 51
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 2 Then one day accompanied by some worthy sons of his father’s ministers friends full of varied converse — with a desire to see the glades of the forest and longing for peace he went out with the king’s permission,atha maṁtrisutaiḥ kṣamaiḥ kadācitsakhibhiścitrakathaiḥ kṛtānuyātraḥ |vanabhūmididṛkṣayā śamepsurnaradevānumato vahiḥ pratasthe || 52
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 3 Having mounted his good horse Kaṁthaka decked with bells and bridle-bit of new gold with beautiful golden harness and the chowrie waving 01 he went forth like the moon 02 mounted on a comet,navarukmakhalīnakiṁkiṇīkaṁ pracalaccāmaracāruhemabhāṁḍam |abhiruhya sa kaṁṭhakaṁ sadaśvaṁ prayayau ketumiva drumābjaketuḥ || 53
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 4 Lured by love of the wood and longing for the beauties of the ground 03 he went to a spot near at hand 04 on the forest-outskirts and there he saw a piece of land being ploughed with the path of the plough broken like waves on the water,sa nikṛṣṭatarāṁ vanāṁtabhūmiṁ vanalobhācca yayau mahīguṇecchuḥ |salilormivikārasīramārgāṁ vasudhāṁ caiva dadarśa kṛṣyamāṇām || 54
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 5 Having beheld the ground in this condition with its young grass scattered and torn by the plough and covered with the eggs and young of little insects which were killed he was filled with deep sorrow as for the slaughter of his own kindred,halabhinnavikīrṇaśaṣpadarbhāṁ hatasūkṣmakrimikāṁḍajaṁtukīrṇām |samavekṣya rasāṁ tathāvidhāṁ tāṁ svajanasyeva badhe bhṛśaṁ śuśoca || 55
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 6 And beholding the men as they were ploughing their complexions spoiled by the dust the sun’s rays and the wind and their cattle bewildered with the burden of drawing the most noble one felt extreme compassion,kṛṣataḥ puruṣāṁśca vīkṣamāṇaḥ pavanārkāṁśurajovibhinnavarṇān |vahanaklamaviklavāṁśca dhuryān paramāryaḥ paramāṁ kṛpāṁ cakāra || 56
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 7 Having alighted from the back of his horse he went over the ground slowly overcome with sorrow — pondering the birth and destruction of the world he grieved exclaimed this is indeed pitiable’,avatīrya tatasturaṁgapṛṣṭhācchanakairgāṁ vyacarat śucā parītaḥ |jagato jananavyayaṁ vicinvan kṛpaṇaṁ khalvidamityuvāca cārttaḥ || 57
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 8 Then desiring to become perfectly lonely in his thoughts having stopped those friends who were following him he went to the root of a rose-apple in a solitary spot which had its beautiful leaves all tremulous (in the wind),manasā ca viviktatāmabhīpsuḥ suhṛdastānanuyāyino nivārya |abhitāralacāruparṇavatyā vijane mūlamupeyivān sa jaṁbvāḥ || 58
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 9 There he sat down on the ground covered with leaves 05 and with its young grass bright like lapis lazuli and meditating on the origin and destruction of the world he laid hold of the path that leads to firmness of mind,niṣasāda ca patrakhoravatyāṁ bhuvi vaidūryanikāśaśādvalāyām |jagataḥ prabhavavyayau viciṁtya manasaśca sthitimārgamālalaṁbe || 59
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 10 Having attained to firmness of mind 06 and being forthwith set free from all sorrows such as the desire of worldly objects and the rest he attained the first stage of contemplation unaffected by sin calm and argumentative’ 07,samavāptamanaḥ sthitiśca sadyo viṣayecchādibhirādhibhiśca muktaḥ |savitarkavicāramāpa śāṁtaṁ prathamaṁ dhyānamanāśravaprakāram || 510
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 11 Having then obtained the highest happiness sprung from deliberation 08 he next pondered this meditation — having thoroughly understood in his mind the course of the world,adhigamya tato vivekajaṁ tu paramaprītisukhaṁ  samādhim |idameva tataḥ paraṁ pradadhyau manasā lokagatiṁ niśamya samyak || 511
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 12 It is a miserable thing that mankind though themselves powerless 09 and subject to sickness old age and death yet blinded by passion and ignorant look with disgust on another who is afflicted by old age or diseased or dead,kṛpaṇaṁ vata yajjanaḥ svayaṁ sannaraso vyādhijarāvināśadharmaḥ |jarayārditamāturaṁ mṛtaṁ vā paramajño vijugupsate madāṁdhaḥ || 512
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 13 If I here being such myself should feel disgust for another who has such a nature it would not be worthy or right in me who know this highest duty’,iha cedahamīdṛśaḥ svayaṁ san vijugupseya paraṁ tathāsvabhāvam |na bhavetsadṛśaṁ hi tatkṣamaṁ vā paramaṁ dharmamimaṁ vijānato me || 513
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 14 As he thus considered thoroughly these faults of sickness old age and death which belong to all living beings all the joy which he had felt in the activity of his vigour his youth and his life vanished in a moment,iti tasya vipaśyato yathāvajjagato vyādhijarāvipattidoṣān |balayauvanajīvitapravṛttau vijagāmātmagato madaḥ kṣaṇena || 514
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 15 He did not rejoice he did not feel remorse he suffered no hesitation indolence nor sleep he felt no drawing towards the qualities of desire he hated not nor scorned another,na jaharṣa na cāpi cānutepe vicikitsāṁ na yayau na taṁdrinidre |na ca kāmaguṇeṣu saṁraraṁje na ca didveṣa paraṁ na cāvamene || 515
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 16 Thus did this pure passionless meditation grow within the great-souled one and unobserved by the other men there crept up a man in a beggar’s dress,iti buddhiriyaṁ ca nīrajaskā vavṛdhe tasya mahātmano viśuddhā |puruṣairaparairadṛśyamānaḥ puruṣaścopasasarpa bhikṣuveśaḥ || 516
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 17 The king’s son asked him a question — he said to him Tell me who art thou’ and the other replied Oh bull of men I being terrified at birth and death have become an ascetic for the sake of liberation,naradevasutastamabhyapṛcchadvada ko sīti śaśaṁsa so tha tasmai |sa ca puṁgava janmamṛtyubhītaḥ śramaṇaḥ pravrajito smi mokṣahetoḥ || 517
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 18 Desiring liberation in a world subject to destruction I seek that happy indestructible abode isolated from mankind with my thoughts unlike those of others and with my sinful passions turned away from all objects of sense,jagati kṣayadharmake mumukṣurmṛgaye haṁ śivamakṣayaṁ padaṁ tat |ajano nyajanairatulyabuddhirviṣayebhyo vinivṛttarāgadoṣaḥ || 518
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 19 Dwelling anywhere at the root of a tree or in an uninhabited house a mountain or a forest — I wander without a family and without hope a beggar ready for any fare seeking only the highest good’,nivasan kvacideva vṛkṣamūle vijane vāyatane girau vane vā |vicarāmyaparigraho nirāśaḥ paramārthāya yathopapannabhikṣuḥ || 519
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 20 When he had thus spoken while the prince was looking on he suddenly flew up to the sky it was a heavenly inhabitant who knowing that the prince’s thoughts were other than what his outward form promised had come to him for the sake of rousing his recollection,iti paśyata eva rājasūnoridamuktvā sa nabhaḥ samutpapāta |sa hi tadvapuranyabuddhidarśī smṛtaye tasya sameyivān divaukāḥ || 520
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 21 When the other was gone like a bird to heaven the foremost of men was rejoiced and astonished and having comprehended the meaning of the term dharma 10 he set his mind on the manner of the accomplishment of deliverance,gaganaṁ khagavadgate ca tasmin nṛvaraḥ saṁjahṛṣe visismiye ca |upalabhya tataśca dharmasaṁjñāmabhiniryāṇavidhau matiṁ cakāra || 521
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 22 Then like Indra himself and having tamed his senses — desiring to return home he mounted his noble steed and having made him turn back as he looked for his friends from that moment he sought no more the desired forest,tata iṁdrasamo jiteṁdriyaśca pravivikṣuḥ paramāśvamāruroha |parivartya janaṁ tvavekṣamāṇastata evābhimataṁ vanaṁ na bheje || 522
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 23 Ever seeking to make an end of old age and death fixing his thoughts in memory on dwelling in the woods he entered the city again but with no feelings of longing like an elephant entering an exercise-ground 11 after roaming in a forest-land,sa jarāmaraṇakṣayaṁ cikīrṣurvanavāsāya matiṁ smṛtau nidhāya |praviveśa punaḥ puraṁ na kāmādvanabhūmeriva maṁḍalaṁ dvipeṁdraḥ || 523
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 24 Happy truly and blessed is that woman whose husband is such as thou O long-eyed prince’ So on seeing him the princess exclaimed folding her hands to welcome him as he entered the road,sukhitā vata nirvṛtā ca sā strī patirīdṛktvamivāyatākṣa yasyāḥ |iti taṁ samudīkṣya rājakanyā praviśaṁtaṁ pathi sāṁjalirjagāda || 524
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 25 He whose voice was deep-sounding like a cloud heard this address and was filled with profound calm and as he heard the word blessed’ 12 he fixed his mind on the attainment of Nirvāṇa,atha ghoṣamimaṁ mahābhraghoṣaḥ pariśuśrāva śamaṁ paraṁ ca lebhe |śrutavāṁśca hi nirvṛteti śabdaṁ parinirvāṇavidhau matiṁ cakāra || 525
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 26 Then the prince whose form was like the peak of a golden mountain — whose eye voice and arm resembled a bull a cloud and an elephant 13 — whose countenance and prowess were like the moon and a lion — having a longing aroused for something imperishable — went into his palace,atha kāṁcanaśailaśṛṁgavarṣmā gajamegharṣabhabāhunisvanākṣaḥ |kṣayamakṣayadharmajātarāgaḥ śaśisiṁhānanavikramaḥ prapede || 526
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 27 Then stepping like a lion he went towards the king who was attended by his numerous counsellors like Sanatkumāra in heaven waiting on Indra resplendent in the assembly 14 of the Maruts,mṛgarājagatistato bhyagacchannṛpatiṁ maṁtrigaṇairupāsyamānam |samitau marutāmiva jvalaṁtaṁ maghavaṁtaṁ tridive sanatkumāraḥ || 527
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 28 Prostrating himself with folded hands he addressed him Grant me graciously thy permission O lord of men — I wish to become a wandering mendicant for the sake of liberation since separation is appointed for me’,praṇipatya ca sāṁjalirbabhāṣe diśa mahyaṁ naradeva sādhvanujñām |parivivrajiṣāmi mokṣahetorniyato hyasya janasya viprayogaḥ || 528
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 29 Having heard his words the king shook like a tree struck by an elephant and having seized his folded hands which were like a lotus he thus addressed him in a voice choked with tears,iti tasya vaco niśamya rājā kariṇevābhihato drumaścacāla |kamalapratime ṁjalau gṛhītvā vacanaṁ cedamuvāca vāṣpakaṁṭhaḥ || 529
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 30 O my son keep back this thought it is not the time for thee to betake thyself to dharma they say that the practice of religion is full of evils in the first period of life when the mind is still fickle,pratisaṁhara tāta buddhimetāṁ na hi kālastava dharmasaṁśrayasya |vayasi prathame matau calāyāṁ bahudoṣāṁ hi vadaṁti dharmacaryām || 530
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 31 The mind of the thoughtless ignorant young man whose senses are eager for worldly objects and who has no power of settled resolution for the hardships of vows of penance shrinks back from the forest for it is especially destitute of discrimination,viṣayeṣu kutūhaleṁdriyasya vratakhedeṣvasamarthaniścayasya |taruṇasya manaścalatyaraṇyādanabhijñasya viśeṣato vivekam || 531
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 32 It is high time for me to practise religion O my child of loved qualities 15 leaving my royal glory to thee who art well worthy to be distinguished by it but thy religion O firm-striding hero is to be accomplished by heroism it would be irreligion if thou wert to leave thine own father,mama tu priyadharma dharmakālastvayi lakṣmīmavasṛjya lakṣyabhūte |sthiravikrama vikrameṇa dharmastava hitvā tu guruṁ bhavedadharmaḥ || 532
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 33 Do thou therefore abandon this thy resolution devote thyself for the present to the duties of a householder to a man who has enjoyed the pleasures of his prime it is delightful to enter the penance-forest’,tadimaṁ vyavasāyamutsṛja tvaṁ bhava tāvannirato gṛhasthadharme |puruṣasya vayaḥsukhāni bhuktvā ramaṇīyo hi tapovanapraveśaḥ || 533
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 34 Having heard these words of the king he made his reply in a voice soft like a sparrow’s If thou wilt be my surety O king against four contingencies I will not betake myself to the forest,iti vākyamidaṁ niśamya rājñaḥ kalaviṁkasvara uttaraṁ babhāṣe |yadi me pratibhūścaturṣu rājan bhavasi tvaṁ na tapovanaṁ śrayiṣye || 534

https//bitly/2vDja4a, 36 When his son uttered a speech so hard to be understood the king of the Śākyas thus replied Abandon this idea bent upon departure extravagant desires are only ridiculous’,iti durlabhamarthamūcivāṁsaṁ tanayaṁ vākyamuvāca śākyarājaḥ |tyaja buddhimatimāṁ gatipravṛttāmavahāsyo timanorathakramaśca || 536
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 37 Then he who was firm as Mount Meru addressed his father If this is impossible then this course of mine is not to be hindered it is not right to lay hold of one who would escape 16 from a house that is on fire,atha merugururguruṁ babhāṣe yadi nāsti krama eṣa nāsti vāryaḥ |śaraṇājjvalanena dahyamānānna hi niścikramiṣuṁ kṣamaṁ grahītum || 537
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 38 As separation is inevitable to the world but not for Dharma 17 this separation is preferable will not death sever me helplessly my objects unattained and myself unsatisfied’,jagataśca yathā dhruvo viyogo na tu dharmāya varaṁ tvayaṁ viyogaḥ |avaśaṁ nanu viprayojayenmāmakṛtasvārthamatṛptameva mṛtyuḥ || 538

https//bitly/2vDja4a, 40 Then having been duly instructed 18 by the counsellors with all respect and affection according to the śāstras and being thus forbidden with tears by his father the prince sorrowing entered into his palace,sacivaistu nidarśito yathāvadbahumānāt praṇayācca śāstrapūrvam |guruṇā ca nivārito śrupātaiḥ praviveśāvasathaṁ tataḥ sa śocan || 540
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 41 There he was gazed at by his wives with restless eyes whose faces were kissed by their dangling earrings and whose bosoms were shaken with their thick-coming sighs — as by so many young fawns,calakuṇdalacuṁbitānanābhirghananiśvāsavikaṁpitastanībhiḥ |vanitābhiradhīralocanābhirmṛgaśāvābhirivābhyudīkṣyamāṇaḥ || 541

https//bitly/2vDja4a, 44 Having ascended he repaired to a special golden seat decorated with embellishments of diamond with tall lighted candlesticks ablaze with gold and its interior filled with the incense of black aloe-wood,kanakojjvaladīptadīpavṛkṣaṁ varakālāgurudhūpapūrṇagarbham |adhiruhya sa vajrabhakticitraṁ pravaraṁ kāṁcanamāsanaṁ siṣeve || 544
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 45 Then the noblest of women waited during the night on the noblest of men who was like Indra himself with a concert of musical instruments as the crowds of heavenly nymphs wait on the son of the Lord of wealth 19 upon the summit of Himavat white like the moon,tata uttamamuttamāśca nāryo niśi tūryairupatasthuriṁdrakalpam |himavacchirasīva caṁdragaure draviṇeṁdrātmajamapsarogaṇaughāḥ || 545
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 46 But even by those beautiful instruments like heavenly music he was not moved to pleasure or delight since his desire to go forth from his home to seek the bliss of the highest end was never lulled,paramairapi divyatūryakalpaiḥ sa tu tairnaiva ratiṁ yayau na harṣam |paramārthasukhāya tasya sādhorabhiniścikramiṣā yato na reme || 546
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 47 Then by the power of the heavenly beings most excellent in self-mortification the Akaniṣṭhas who knew the purpose of his heart deep sleep was suddenly thrown on that company of women and their limbs and gestures became distorted 20,atha tatra suraistapovariṣṭhairakaniṣṭhairvyavasāyamasya buddhvā |yugapatpramadājanasya nidrā vihitāsīdvikṛtāśca gātraceṣṭāḥ || 547
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 48 One was lying there resting her cheek on her trembling arm leaving as in anger her lute though dearly loved which lay on her side decorated with gold-leaf,abhavacchayitā hi tatra kācidviniveśya pracale kare kapolam |dayitāmapi rukmapattracitrāṁ kupitevāṁkagatāṁ vihāya vīṇām || 548
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 49 Another shone with her flute clinging to her hand lying with her white garments fallen from her bosom — like a river whose banks are smiling with the foam of the water and whose lotuses are covered with a straight line of bees 21,vibabhau karalagnaveṇuranyā stanavisrastasitāṁśukā śayānā |ṛjuṣaṭpadapaṁktijuṣṭapadmā jalaphenaprahasattaṭā nadīva || 549
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 50 Another was sleeping 22 embracing her drum as a lover with her two arms tender like the shoot of young lotus and bearing their bracelets closely linked blazing with gold,navapuṣkaragarbhakomalābhyāṁ tapanīyojjvalasaṁgatāṁgadābhyām |svapiti sma tathā purā bhujābhyāṁ parirabhya priyavanmṛdaṁgameva || 550
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 51 Others decked with new golden ornaments and wearing peerless yellow garments fell down alas helpless with sleep like the boughs of the Karṇikāra broken by an elephant,navahāṭakabhūṣaṇāstathānyā vasanaṁ pītamanuttamaṁ vasānāḥ |avaśā vata nidrayā nipeturgajabhagnā iva karṇikāraśākhāḥ || 551
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 52 Another leaning on the side of a window with her willow-form bent like a bow shone as she lay with her beautiful necklace hanging down like a statue 23 in an archway made by art,avalaṁbya gavākṣapārśvamanyā śayitā cāpavibhugnagātrayaṣṭiḥ |virarāja vilaṁbicāruhārā racitā toraṇaśālabhaṁjikeva || 552
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 53 The lotus-face of another bowed down with the pinguent-lines on her person rubbed by the jewelled earrings appeared to be a lotus with its stalk bent into a half-circle and shaken by a duck standing on it 24,maṇikuṁḍaladaṣṭapatralekhaṁ mukhapadmaṁ vinataṁ tathāparasyāḥ |śatapatramivārdhacakranāḍaṁ sthitakāraṁḍavaghaṭṭitaṁ cakāśe || 553
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 54 Others lying as they sat with their limbs oppressed by the weight of their bosoms shone in their beauty mutually clasping one another with their twining arms decorated with golden bracelets,aparāḥ śayitā yathopaviṣṭāḥ stanabhārairavamanyamānagātrāḥ |upaguhya parasparaṁ virejurbhujapāśaistapanīyapārihāryaiḥ || 554
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 55 And another damsel lay sound asleep embracing her big lute as if it were a female friend and rolled it about while its golden strings trembled with her own face bright with her shaken earrings,mahatīṁ parivādinīṁ ca kācidvanitāliṁgya sakhīmiva prasuptā |vijughūrṇa calatsuvarṇasūtrāṁ vadanenākulakarṇikojjvalena || 555

https//bitly/2vDja4a, 57 Others showed no lustre with their eyes shut although they were really full-eyed and fair-browed — like the lotus-beds with their buds closed at the setting of the sun,aparā na babhurnimīlitākṣyo vipulākṣyo pi śubhabhruvo pi satyaḥ |pratisaṁkucitāraviṁdakośāḥ savitaryastamite yathā nalinyaḥ || 557
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 58 Another with her hair loose and dishevelled and her skirts and ornaments fallen from her loins lay with her necklace in confusion like a woman crushed by an elephant and then dropped,śithilākulamūrdhajā tathānyā jaghanasrastavibhūṣaṇāṁśukāṁtā |aśayiṣṭa vikīrṇakaṁṭhasūtrā gajabhagnā pratipātitāṁganeva || 558
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 59 Others helpless and lost to shame though naturally self-possessed and endued with all graces of person breathed violently as they lay and yawned with their arms distorted and tossed about,aparāstvavaśā hriyā viyuktā dhṛtimatyo pi vapurguṇairupetāḥ |viniśaśvasurulvaṇaṁ śayānā vikṛtākṣiptabhujā jajṛṁbhire ca || 559
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 60 Others with their ornaments and garlands thrown off — unconscious with their garments spread out unfastened — their bright eyes wide open and motionless — lay without any beauty as if they were dead,vyapaviddhavibhūṣaṇasrajo nyā visṛtāgraṁthanavāsaso visaṁjñāḥ |animīlitaśuklaniścalākṣyo na virejuḥ śayitā gatāsukalpāḥ || 560
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 61 Another with fully-developed limbs her mouth wide open her saliva dropping and her person exposed lay as though sprawling in intoxication — she spoke not but bore every limb distorted,vivṛtāsyapuṭā vivṛddhagātrā prapatadvaktrajalā prakāśaguhyā |aparā madaghūrṇiteva śiśye na babhāṣe vikṛtaṁ vapuḥ pupoṣa || 561
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 62 Thus that company of women lying in different attitudes according to their disposition and family bore the aspect of a lake whose lotuses were bent down and broken by the wind,iti sattvakulānurūparūpaṁ vividhaṁ sa pramadājanaḥ śayānaḥ |sarasaḥ sadṛśaṁ babhāra rūpaṁ pavanāvarjitarugṇapuṣkarasya || 562
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 63 Then having seen these young women thus lying distorted and with uncontrolled gestures however excellent their forms and graceful their appearance — the king’s son felt moved with scorn,samavekṣya tataśca tāḥ śayānā vikṛtāstā yuvatīradhīraceṣṭāḥ |guṇavadvapuṣo pi valgubhāso nṛpasūnuḥ sa vigarhayāṁ babhūva || 563
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 64 Such is the nature of women impure and monstrous in the world of living beings but deceived by dress and ornaments a man becomes infatuated by a woman’s attractions,aśucirvikṛtaśca jīvaloke vanitānāmayamīdṛśaḥ svabhāvaḥ |vasanābharaṇaistu vaṁcyamānaḥ puruṣaḥ strīviṣayeṣu rāgameti || 564
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 65 If a man would but consider the natural state of women and this change produced in them by sleep assuredly he would not cherish his folly but he is smitten from a right will and so succumbs to passion’,vimṛśedyadi yoṣitāṁ manuṣyaḥ prakṛtiṁ svapnavikāramīdṛśaṁ ca |dhruvamatra na vardhayetpramādaṁ guṇasaṁkalpahatastu rāgameti || 565
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 66 Thus to him having recognised that difference there arose a desire to escape in the night and then the gods knowing his purpose caused the door of the palace to fly open,iti tasya tadaṁtaraṁ viditvā niśi niścikramiṣā samudbabhūva |avagamya manastato sya devairbhavanadvāramapāvṛtaṁ babhūva || 566
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 67 Then he went down from the roof of the palace scorning those women who lay thus distorted and having descended undauntedly he went out first into the courtyard 26,atha so vatatāra harmyapṛṣṭhādyuvatīstāḥ śayitā vigarhamāṇaḥ |avatīrya tataśca nirviśaṁko gṛhakakṣyāṁ prathamaṁ vinirjagāma || 567
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 68 Having awakened his horse’s attendant the swift Chaṁdaka he thus addressed him Bring me quickly my horse Kaṁthaka 27 I wish to-day to go hence to attain immortality,turagāvacaraṁ sa bodhayitvā javinaṁ chaṁdakamitthamityuvāca |hayamānaya kaṁthakaṁ tvarāvān amṛtaṁ prāptumito dya me yiyāsā || 568
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 69 Since such is the firm content which to-day is produced in my heart and since my determination is settled in calm resolve and since even in loneliness I seem to possess a guide — verily the end which I desire is now before me,hṛdi yā mama tuṣṭiradya jātā vyavasāyaśca yathā dhṛtau niviṣṭaḥ |vijane pi ca nāthavānivāsmi dhruvamartho bhimukhaḥ sa me ya iṣṭaḥ || 569
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 70 Since abandoning all shame and modesty these women lay before me as they did and the two doors opened of their own accord verily the time is come to depart for my true health’,hriyameva ca saṁnatiṁ ca hitvā śayitā matpramukhe yathā yuvatyaḥ |vivṛte ca yathā svayaṁ kapāṭe niyataṁ yātumanāmayāya kālaḥ || 570
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 71 Then accepting his lord’s command though he knew the purport of the king’s injunctions as being urged by a higher power in his mind he set himself to bring the horse,pratigṛhya tataḥ sa bharturājñāṁ viditārtho pi nareṁdraśāsanasya |manasīva pareṇa codyamānasturagasyānayane matiṁ cakāra || 571
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 72 Then he brought out for his master that noble steed his mouth furnished with a golden bit his back lightly touched by the bed on which he had been lying and endued with strength vigour speed and swiftness 28,atha hemakhalīnapūrṇavaktraṁ laghuśayyāstaraṇopagūḍhapṛṣṭham |balasattvajavatvaropapannaṁ sa varāśvaṁ tamupānināya bhartre || 572
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 73 With a long chine and root of the tail and heel — gentle with short hair back and ears — with his back belly and sides depressed and elevated with broad nostrils forehead hips and breast 29,pratatatrikapucchamūlapārṣṇiṁ nibhṛtaṁ hrasvatanūjapṛṣṭhakarṇam |vinatonnatapṛṣṭhakukṣipārśvaṁ vipulaprothalalāṭakaṭhyuraskam || 573
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 74 The broad-chested hero having embraced him and caressing him with his lotus-like hand ordered him with a gentle-toned voice as if he were desirous to plunge into the middle of an army,upaguhya sa taṁ viśālavakṣāḥ kamalābhena ca sāṁtvayan kareṇa |madhurākṣarayā girā śaśāsa dhvajinīmadhyamiva praveṣṭukāmaḥ || 574
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 75 Oftentimes have evil enemies been overthrown by the king when mounted on thee do thou O best of steeds so exert thyself that I too may obtain the highest immortality 30,bahuśaḥ kaliśatravo nirastāḥ samare tvāmadhiruhya pārthivena |ahamapyamṛtaṁ paraṁ yathāvatturagaśreṣṭha labheya tatkuruṣva || 575
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 76 Companions are easy to be found in battle or in the happiness obtained by winning worldly objects or in attaining wealth but companions are hard for a man to find who has fallen into misfortune or when he flies for refuge to Dharma,sulabhāḥ khalu saṁyuge sahāyā viṣayāvāptasukhe dhanārjane vā |puruṣasya tu durlabhāḥ sahāyāḥ patitasyāpadi dharmasaṁśraye vā || 576
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 77 And yet all those who in this world are companions whether in sinful custom or in seeking for Dharma — as my inner soul now recognises — they too are verily sharers in the common aim,iha caiva bhavaṁti ye sahāyāḥ kaluṣe dharmaṇi dharmasaṁśraye vā |avagacchati me yathāṁtarātmā niyataṁ te pi janāstadaṁśabhājaḥ || 577
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 78 Since then when I attain this righteous end my escape from hence will be for the good of the world — O best of steeds by thy speed and energy strive for thine own good and the good of the world’,tadidaṁ parigamya dharmayuktaṁ mama niryāṇamato jagaddhitāya |turagottama vegavikramābhyāṁ prayatasvātmahite jagaddhite ca || 578
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 79 Thus having exhorted the best of steeds like a friend to his duty he the best of men longing to go to the forest wearing a noble form in brightness like fire 31 mounted the white horse as the sun an autumnal cloud,iti suhṛdamivānuśiṣya kṛtye turagavaraṁ nṛvaro vanaṁ yiyāsuḥ |sitamasitagatidyutirvapuṣmān raviriva śāradamabhramāruroha || 579
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 80 Then that good steed avoiding all noises which would sound startling in the dead of night and awaken the household — all sound of his jaws hushed and his neighing silenced — went forth planting his hurrying steps at full speed,atha sa pariharanniśīthacaṁḍaṁ parijanabodhakaraṁ dhvaniṁ sadaśvaḥ |vigatahanuravaḥ praśāṁtaheṣaścakitavimuktapadakramā jagāma || 580
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 81 With their lotus-like hands whose fore-arms were adorned with golden bracelets the Yakṣas with their bodies bent down threw lotuses and bore up his hoofs as he rushed in startled haste,kanakavalayabhūṣitaprakoṣṭhaiḥ kamalanibhaiḥ kamalāni ca pravidhya |avanatatanavastato sya yakṣāścakitagaterdadhire khurān karāgraiḥ || 581
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 82 The city-roads which were closed with heavy gates and bars and which could be with difficulty opened 32 even by elephants flew open of their own accord without noise as the prince went through,guruparighakapāṭasaṁvṛtā yā na sukhamapi dviradairapāvriyaṁte |vrajati nṛpasute gatasvanāstāḥ svayamabhavan vivṛtāḥ puraḥ pratolyaḥ || 582
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 83 Firm in his resolve and leaving behind without hesitation his father who turned ever towards him 33 and his young son his affectionate people and his unparalleled magnificence he then went forth out of his father’s city,pitaramabhimukhaṁ sutaṁ ca bālaṁ janamanuraktamanuttamāṁ ca lakṣmīm |kṛtamatirapahāya nirvyapekṣaḥ pitṛnagarāt sa tato vinirjagāma || 583
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 84 Then he with his eyes long and like a full-blown lotus looking back on the city uttered a sound like a lion Till I have seen the further shore of birth and death I will never again enter the city called after Kapila’,atha sa vikacapaṁkajāyatākṣaḥ puramavalokya nanāda siṁhanādam |jananamaraṇayoradṛṣṭapāro na punarahaṁ kapilāhvayaṁ praviṣṭā || 584
https//bitly/2vDja4a, 85 Having heard this his utterance the troops of the court of the Lord of wealth 34 rejoiced and the hosts of the gods triumphing wished him a successful accomplishment of his purpose,iti vacanamidaṁ niśamya tasya draviṇapateḥ pariṣadgaṇā nanaṁduḥ | 585pramuditamanasaśca devasaṁghā vyavasitapāraṇamāśaśaṁsire smai ||

https//bitly/2vDja4a, 87 But he with his horse like the horse of Indra the lord of bay horses hurrying on as if spurred in his mind went over the leagues full of many conflicting emotions 35 — the sky all the while with its cloud-masses checkered with the light of the dawn,harituragaturaṁgavatturaṁgaḥ sa tu vicaran manasīva codyamānaḥ |aruṇaparuṣabhāramaṁtarīkṣaṁ sarasabahūni jagāma yojanāni || 587

https//bitly/2vGxl75, 3 For the sake of ending his wonder and to show reverence for the penances observed and as expressing his own conformity therewith 01 he alighted from the back of his horse,sa vismayanivṛttyarthaṁ tapaḥpūjārthameva ca |svāṁ cānuvartitāṁ rakṣannaśvapṛṣṭhādavātarat || 63
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 4 Having alighted he stroked the horse exclaiming All is saved’ and he spoke well-pleased to Chaṁdaka bedewing him as it were with tears from his eyes ,avatīrya ca pasparśa nistīrṇamiti vājinam |chaṁdakaṁ cābravīt prītaḥ snāpayanniva cakṣuṣā || 64

https//bitly/2vGxl75, 33 Thou wilt not surely abandon thy queen endowed with all virtues illustrious for her family devoted to her husband and with a young son as a coward the royal dignity within his reach,bālaputrāṁ guṇavatīṁ kulaślāghyāṁ pativratām |devīmarhasi na tyaktuṁ klīvaḥ prāptāmiva śriyam || 633
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 34 Thou wilt not abandon the young son of Yaśodharā worthy of all praise thou the best of the cherishers of religion and fame as a dissolute spendthrift his choicest glory,putraṁ yāśodharaṁ ślāghyaṁ yaśodharmabhṛtāṁ varaḥ |bālamarhasi na tyaktuṁ vyasanīvottamaṁ yaśaḥ || 634
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 35 Or even if thy mind be resolved to abandon thy kindred and thy kingdom thou wilt not O master abandon me — thy feet are my only refuge,atha baṁdhuṁ ca rājyaṁ ca tyaktumeva kṛtā matiḥ |māṁ nārhasi vibho tyaktuṁ tvatpādau hi gatirmama || 635
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 36 I cannot go to the city with my soul thus burning leaving thee behind in the forest as Sumitra 06 left the son of Raghu,nāsmi yātuṁ puraṁ śakto dahyamānena cetasā |tvāmaraṇye parityajya sumitra iva rāghavam || 636
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 37 What will the king say to me returning to the city without thee or what shall I say to thy queens by way of telling them good news,kiṁ hi vakṣyati rājā māṁ tvadṛte nagaraṁ gatam |vakṣyāmyucitadarśitvātkiṁ tavāṁtaḥpurāṇi vā || 637
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 38 As for what thou saidst thou must repeat my unworthiness to the king — how shall I speak what is false of thee as of a sage without a fault,yadapyātthāpi nairguṇyaṁ vācyaṁ narapatāviti |kiṁ tadvakṣyāmyabhūtaṁ te nirdoṣasya muneriva || 638
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 39 Or even if I ventured to speak it with a heart ashamed and a tongue cleaving to my mouth who would think of believing it,hṛdayena salajjena jihvayā sajjamānayā |ahaṁ yadyapi vā brūyāṁ kastacchraddhātumarhati || 639
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 40 He who would tell of or believe the fierceness of the moon might tell of or believe thy faults O physician of faults,yo hi caṁdramasastaikṣṇya kathayecchraddadhīta vā |sa doṣāṁstava doṣajña kathayecchraddadhīta vā || 640
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 41 Him who is always compassionate and who never fails to feel pity it ill befits to abandon one who loves — turn back and have mercy on me’,sānukrośasya satataṁ nityaṁ karuṇavedinaḥ |snigdhatyāgo na sadṛśo nivartasva prasīda me || 641
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 42 Having heard these words of Chaṁda overcome with sorrow — self-possessed with the utmost firmness the best of speakers answered,iti śokābhibhūtasya śrutvā chaṁdasya bhāṣitam |svasthaḥ paramayā dhṛtyā jagāda vadatāṁ varaḥ || 642
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 43 Abandon this distress Chaṁda regarding thy separation from me — change is inevitable in corporeal beings who are subject to different births,madviyogaṁ prati cchaṁda saṁtāpastyajyatāmayam |nānābhāvo hi niyataṁ pṛthagjātiṣu dehiṣu || 643
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 44 Even if I through affection were not to abandon my kindred in my desire for liberation death would still make us helplessly abandon one another,svajanaṁ yadyapi snehānna tyajeyaṁ mumukṣayā |mṛtyuranyonyamavaśānasmān saṁtyājayiṣyati || 644
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 45 She my mother by whom I was borne in the womb with great thirst and pains — where am I now with regard to her all her efforts fruitless and where is she with regard to me,mahatyā tṛṣṇayā duḥkhairgarbheṇāsmi yayā dhṛtaḥ |tasyā niṣphalayatnāyāḥ kvāhaṁ mātuḥ kva sā mama || 645
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 46 As birds go to their roosting-tree and then depart so the meeting of beings inevitably ends in separation,vāsavṛkṣe samāgamya vigacchaṁti yathāṁḍajāḥ |niyataṁ viprayogāṁtastathā bhūtasamāgamaḥ || 646

https//bitly/2vGxl75, 48 And since this world goes away each one of us deceiving the other — it is not right to think anything thine own in a time of union which is a dream,yasmādyāti ca loko yaṁ vipralabhya parasparam |mamatvaṁ na kṣamaṁ tasmātsvapnabhūte samāgame || 648
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 49 Since the trees are parted from the innate colour of their leaves why should there not still more be the parting of two things which are alien to each other,sahajena viyujyaṁte parṇarāgeṇa pādapāḥ |anyenānyasya viśleṣaḥ kiṁ punarna bhaviṣyati || 649
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 50 Therefore since it is so grieve not my good friend but go or if thy love lingers then go and afterwards return,tadevaṁ sati saṁtāpaṁ mā kārṣīḥ saumya gamyatām |laṁbate yadi tu sneho gatvāpi punarāvraja || 650
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 51 Say without reproaching us to the people in Kapilavastu “Let your love for him be given up and hear his resolve,brūyāścāsmāsvanākṣepaṁ janaṁ kapilavastuni |tyajyatāṁ tadgataḥ snehaḥ śrūyatāṁ cāsya niścayaḥ || 651
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 52 “Either he will quickly come back having destroyed old age and death or else he will himself perish having failed in his purpose and lost hold of every support” ,kṣiprameṣyati vā kṛtvā jarāmṛtyukṣayaṁ kila |akṛtārtho nirālaṁbo nidhanaṁ yāsyatīti vā || 652
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 53 Having heard his words Kaṁthaka the noblest of steeds licked his feet with his tongue and dropped hot tears,iti tasya vacaḥ śrutvā kaṁthakasturagottamaḥ |jihvayā lilihe pādau vāṣpamuṣṇaṁ mumoca ca || 653
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 54 With his hand whose fingers were united with a membrane and which was marked with the auspicious svastika and with its middle part curved 07 the prince stroked him and addressed him like a friend,jālinā svastikāṁkena vakramadhyena pāṇinā |āmamarśa kumārastaṁ babhāṣe ca vayasyavat || 654
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 55 Shed not tears Kaṁthaka this thy perfect equine nature has been proved — bear with it this thy labour will soon have its fruit’,muṁca kaṁthaka mā vāṣpaṁ darśiteyaṁ sadaśvatā |mṛṣyatāṁ saphalaḥ śīghraṁ śramaste yaṁ bhaviṣyati || 655
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 56 Then seizing the sharp jewelled sword which was in Chaṁdaka’s hand he resolutely drew out from the sheath the blade decked with golden ornaments like a serpent from its hole,maṇitsaruṁ chaṁdakahastasaṁsthaṁ tataḥ sa dhīro niśitaṁ gṛhītvā |kośādasiṁ kāṁcanabhakticitraṁ vilādivāśīviṣamudbabarha || 656
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 57 Having drawn it forth dark blue like a blue lotus petal he cut his decorated tiara and his hair and he tossed it with its scattered muslin into the air as a grey goose into a lake,niṣkāsya taṁ cotpalapattranīlaṁ ciccheda citraṁ mukuṭaṁ sakeśam |vikīryamāṇāṁśukamaṁtarīkṣe cikṣepa cainaṁ sarasīva haṁsam || 657
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 58 And the heavenly beings with a longing to worship it seized it respectfully as it was thrown up and the divine hosts paid it due adoration in heaven with celestial honours,pūjābhilāṣeṇa ca bāhumānyāddivaukasastaṁ jagṛhuḥ praviddham |yathāvadenaṁ divi devasaṁghā divyairviśeṣairmahayāṁ ca cakruḥ || 658
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 59 Having thus divorced his ornaments and banished all royal magnificence from his head and seeing his muslin floating away like a golden goose the stedfast prince desired a sylvan dress,muktvā tvalaṁkārakalatravattāṁ śrīvipravāsaṁ śirasaśca kṛtvā |dṛṣṭvāṁśukaṁ kāṁcanahaṁsacitram vanyaṁ sa dhīro bhicakāṁkṣa vāsaḥ || 659
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 60 Then a celestial being wearing the form of a hunter pure in heart knowing his thoughts approached near him in dark-red garments and the son of the Śākya king thus addressed him,tato mṛgavyādhavapurdivaukā bhāvaṁ viditvāsya viśuddhabhāvaḥ |kāṣāyavastro bhiyayau samīpaṁ taṁ śākyarājaprabhavo bhyuvāca || 660
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 61 Thy red garments are auspicious the sign of a saint but this destructive bow is not befitting therefore my good friend if there is no strong preference in the matter do thou give me that dress and take this of mine’,śivaṁ ca kāṣāyamṛṣidhvajaste na yujyate hiṁsramidaṁ dhanuśca |tatsaumya yadyasti na saktiratra mahyaṁ prayacchedamidaṁ gṛhāṇa || 661
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 62 The hunter replied It has given me my desire 08 O giver of desires as by this I have inspired animals with confidence and then killed them but if thou hast need of it O thou who art like Indra accept it at once and give me the white dress’,vyādho bravītkāmada kāmamārādanena viśvāsya mṛgān nihatya |arthastu śakropama yadyanena haṁta pratīcchānaya śuklametat || 662
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 63 With extreme joy he then took that sylvan dress and gave away the linen one and the hunter assuming his heavenly form having taken the white garment went to heaven,pareṇa harṣeṇa tataḥ sa vanyaṁ jagrāha vāso ṁśukamutsasarja |vyādhastu divyaṁ vapureva bibhrat tacchuklamādāya divaṁ jagāma || 663
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 64 Then the prince and the attendant of the horse were filled with wonder as he was thus going and forthwith they paid great honour anew to that sylvan dress,tataḥ kumāraśca sa cāśvagopastasmiṁstathā yāti visismiyāte |āraṇyake vāsasi caiva bhūyastasminnakārṣṭāṁ bahumānamāśu || 664
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 65 Then the great-souled one having dismissed the weeping Chaṁda and wearing his fame veiled by the sign of the red garment went towards the hermitage like the king of mountains wrapped in an evening cloud,chaṁdaṁ tataḥ sāśrumukhaṁ visṛjya kāṣāyasaṁvidvṛtakīrtibhṛtsaḥ |yenāśramastena yayau mahātmā saṁdhyābhrasaṁvīta ivādrirājaḥ || 665
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 66 While his master thus regardless of his kingdom was going to the ascetic-wood in mean garments the groom tossing up his arms wailed bitterly and fell on the ground,tatastathā bhartari rājyaniḥspṛhe tapovanaṁ yāti vivarṇavāsasi |bhujau samutkṣipya tataḥ sa vājibhṛdbhṛśaṁ vicukrośa papāta ca kṣitau || 666
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 67 Having looked again he wept aloud and embraced the horse Kaṁthaka with his arms and then hopeless and repeatedly lamenting he went in body to the city not in soul,vilokya bhūyaśca ruroda sasvaraṁ hayaṁ bhujābhyāmupaguhya kaṁthakam |tato nirāśo vilapanmuhurmuhuryayau śarīreṇa puraṁ na cetasā || 667
https//bitly/2vGxl75, 68 Sometimes he pondered sometimes he lamented sometimes he stumbled and sometimes he fell and so going along wretched through his devoted attachment he performed all kinds of actions in the road without conscious will,kvacitpradadhyau vilalāpa ca kvacit kvacitpracaskhāla papāta ca kvacit |ato vrajan bhaktivaśena duḥkhitaścacāra bahvīravaśaḥ pathi kriyāḥ || 668
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 1 Then having left the weeping tear-faced Chaṁda — indifferent to all things in his longing for the forest he by whom all objects are accomplished overpowering the place by his beauty entered that hermitage as if it were fully blessed,tato visṛjyāśrumukhaṁ rudaṁtaṁ chaṁdaṁ vanacchaṁdatayā nirāsthaḥ |sarvārthasiddho vapuṣābhibhūya tamāśramaṁ siddhamiva prapede || 71
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 2 He the prince with a gait like the lion’s having entered that arena of deer himself like a deer — by the beauty of his person even though bereft of his magnificence attracted the eyes of all the dwellers in the hermitage,sa rājasūnurmṛgarājagāmī mṛgājiraṁ tanmṛgavat praviṣṭaḥ |lakṣmīviyukto pi śarīralakṣmyā cakṣūṁṣi sarvāśramiṇāṁ jahāra || 72
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 3 The drivers of wheeled carriages also with their wives stood still in curiosity holding the yokes in their hands — they gazed on him who was like Indra and moved not standing like their beasts of burden with their heads half bent down,sthitā hi hastasthayugāstathaiva kautūhalāccakradharāḥ sadārāḥ |tamiṁdrakalpaṁ dadṛśurna jagmurdhuryā ivārdhāvanataiḥ śirobhiḥ || 73
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 4 And the Brāhmans who had gone outside for the sake of fuel having come with their hands full of fuel flowers and kusa grass — pre-eminent as they were in penances and proficients in wisdom went to see him and went not to their cells,viprāśca gatvā bahiridhmahetoḥ prāptāḥ samitpuṣpapavitrahastāḥ |tapaḥpradhānāḥ kṛtabuddhayo pi taṁ draṣṭumīyurna maṭhānabhīyuḥ || 74
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 5 Delighted the peacocks uttered their cries as if they had seen a dark-blue cloud rising up and leaving the young grass and coming forward the deer with restless eyes and the ascetics who grazed like deer 01 stood still,hṛṣṭāśca kekā mumucurmayūrā dṛṣṭvāṁbudaṁ nīlamivonnamaṁtam |śaṣpāṇi hitvābhimukhāśca tasthurmṛgāścalākṣā mṛgacāriṇaśca || 75
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 6 Beholding him the lamp of the race of Ikṣvāku shining like the rising sun — even though their milking was over being filled with joy the oblation-giving cows poured forth their milk,dṛṣṭvā tamikṣvākukulapradīpaṁ jvalaṁtamudyaṁtamivāṁśumaṁtam |kṛte pi dohe janitapramodāḥ prasusruvurhomaduhaśca gāvaḥ || 76
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 7 It is one of the eight Vasus or one of the two Aśvins descended here’ — these words arose uttered aloud by the sages in their astonishment at seeing him,kaścidvasūnāmayamaṣṭamaḥ syātsyādaśvinoranyataraścyuto tra |ucceruruccairiti tatra vācastaddarśanādvismayajā munīnām || 77
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 8 Like a second form of the lord of the gods 02 like the personified glory of the universe he lighted up the entire wood like the sun come down of his own accord,lekharṣabhasyeva vapurdvitīyaṁ dhāmeva lokasya carācarasya |sa dyotayāmāsa vanaṁ hi kṛtsnaṁ yadṛcchayā sūrya ivāvatīrṇaḥ || 78
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 9 Then he being duly honoured and invited to enter by those dwellers in the hermitage paid his homage to the saints with a voice like a cloud in the rainy season 03,tataḥ sa tairāśramibhiryathāvadabhyarcitaścopanimaṁtritaśca |pratyarcayāṁ dharmabhṛto babhūva svareṇa bhādrāṁbudharopamena || 79
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 10 He the wise one longing for liberation traversed that hermitage filled with the holy company desirous of heaven — gazing at their strange penances,kīrṇaṁ tataḥ puṇyakṛtā janena svargābhikāmena vimokṣakāmaḥ |tamāśramaṁ so nucacāra dhīrastapāṁsi citrāṇi nirīkṣamāṇaḥ || 710
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 11 He the gentle one having seen the different kinds of penance practised by the ascetics in that sacred grove — desiring to know the truth thus addressed one of the ascetics who was following him,tapovikārāṁśca nirīkṣya saumyastapovane tatra tapodhanānām |tapasvinaṁ kaṁcidanuvrajaṁtaṁ tattvaṁ vijijñāsuridaṁ babhāṣe || 711
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 12 Since this to-day is my first sight of a hermitage I do not understand this rule of penance therefore will your honour kindly explain to me what resolve possesses each one of you’,tatpūrvamadyāśramadarśanaṁ me yasmādimaṁ dharmavidhiṁ na jāne |tasmādbhavānarhati bhāṣituṁ me yo niścayo yaṁ prati vaḥ pravṛttaḥ || 712
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 13 Then the Brāhman well-versed in penance told in order to that bull of the Śākyas a very bull in prowess all the various kinds of penance and the fruit thereof,tato dvijātiḥ sa tapovihāraḥ śākyarṣabhāyarṣabhavikramāya |kramena tasmai kathayāṁcakāra tapoviśeṣaṁ tapasaḥ phalaṁ ca || 713
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 14 Uncultivated food growing out of the water leaves water and roots and fruits — this is the fare of the saints according to the sacred texts but the different alternatives of penance vary,agrāmyamannaṁ salilaprarūḍhaṁ parṇāni toyaṁ phalamūlameva |yathāgamaṁ vṛttiriyaṁ munīnāṁ bhinnāstu te te tapasāṁ vikalpāḥ || 714
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 15 Some live like the birds on gleaned corn others graze on grass like the deer others live on air with the snakes as if turned into ant-hills 04,uṁchena jīvaṁti khagā ivānye tṛṇāni kecinmṛgavaccaraṁti |kecidbhujaṁgaiḥ saha vartayaṁti valmīkabhūtā iva mārutena || 715
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 16 Others win their nourishment with great effort from stones others eat corn ground with their own teeth some having boiled for others dress for themselves what may chance to be left,aśmaprayatnārjitavṛttayo nye kecitsvadaṁtāpahatānnabhakṣāḥ |kṛtvā parārthaṁ śrapaṇaṁ tathānye kurvaṁti kāryaṁ yadi śeṣamasti || 716
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 17 Others with their tufts of matted hair continually wet with water twice offer oblations to Agni with hymns others plunging like fishes into the water dwell there with their bodies scratched by tortoises,kecijjalaklinnajaṭākalāpā dviḥ pāvakaṁ juhvati maṁtrapūrvam |mīnaiḥ samaṁ kecidapo vigāhya vasaṁti kūrmollikhitaiḥ śarīraiḥ || 717
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 18 By such penances endured for a time — by the higher they attain heaven by the lower the world of men by the path of pain they eventually dwell in happiness — pain they say is the root of merit’,evaṁvidhaiḥ kālacitaistapobhiḥ parairdivaṁ yāṁtyaparairnṛlokam |duḥkhena mārgeṇa sukhaṁ kṣiyaṁti duḥkhaṁ hi dharmasya vadaṁti mūlam || 718
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 19 The king’s son having heard this speech of the ascetic even though he saw no lofty truth in it 05 was not content but gently uttered these thoughts to himself,ityevamādi dvipadeṁdravatsaḥ śrutvā vacastasya tapodhanasya |adṛṣṭatattvo pi na saṁtutoṣa śanairidaṁ cātmagataṁ jagāda || 719
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 20 The penance is full of pain and of many kinds and the fruit of the penance is mainly heaven at its best and all the worlds are subject to change verily the labour of the hermitages is spent for but little gain,duḥkhātmakaṁ naikavidhaṁ tapaśca svargapradhānaṁ tapasaḥ phalaṁ ca |lokāśca sarve pariṇāmavaṁtaḥ svalpe śramaḥ khalvayamāśramāṇām || 720
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 21 Those who abandoning wealth kindred and worldly objects undertake vows for the sake of heaven — they when parted only wish to go to a still greater wood of their own again 06,śriyaṁ ca baṁdhūn viṣayāṁśca hitvā ye svargahetau niyamaṁ caraṁti |te viprayuktāḥ khalu gaṁtukāmā mahattaraṁ svaṁ vanameva bhūyaḥ || 721
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 22 He who by all these bodily toils which are called penances seeks a sphere of action for the sake of desire — not examining the inherent evils of mundane existence he only seeks pain by pain,kāyaklamairyaśca tapo bhidhānaiḥ pravṛttimākāṁkṣati kāmahetoḥ |saṁsāradoṣānaparīkṣamāṇo duḥkhena so nvicchati duḥkhameva || 722
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 23 There is ever to living creatures fear from death and they with all their efforts seek to be born again where there is action there must inevitably be death — he is always drowned therein just because he is afraid,trāsaśca nityaṁ maraṇātprajānāṁ yatnena cecchaṁti punaḥ prasūtim |satyāṁ pravṛttau niyataśca mṛtyustatraiva magno yata eva bhītaḥ || 723
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 24 Some undergo misery for the sake of this world others meet toil for the sake of heaven all living beings wretched through hope and always missing their aim fall certainly for the sake of happiness into misery,ihārthameke praviśaṁti khedaṁ svargārthamanye śramamāpnuvaṁti |sukhārthamāśākṛpaṇo kṛtārthaḥ patatyanarthe khalu jīvalokaḥ || 724
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 25 It is not the effort itself which I blame — which flinging aside the base pursues a high path of its own but the wise by all this common toil ought to attain that state in which nothing needs ever to be done again,na khalvayaṁ garhita eva yatno yo hīnamutsṛjya viśeṣagāmī |prājñaiḥ samānena pariśrameṇa kāryaṁ tu tadyatra punarna kāryam || 725
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 26 If the mortification of the body here is religion then the body’s happiness is only irreligion but by religion a man obtains happiness in the next world therefore religion here bears irreligion as its fruit,śarīrapīḍā tu yadīha dharmaḥ sukhaṁ śarīrasya bhavatyadharmaḥ |dharmeṇa cāpnoti sukhaṁ paratra tasmādadharmaṁ phalatīha dharmaḥ || 726
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 27 Since it is only by the mind’s authority that the body either acts or ceases to act therefore to control the thought is alone befitting — without the thought the body is like a log,yataḥ śarīraṁ manaso vaśena pravartate vāpi nivartate vā |yukto damaścetasa eva tasmāccittādṛte kāṣṭhasamaṁ śarīram || 727
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 28 If merit is gained by purity of food then there is merit also in the deer and in those men also who live as outcasts from all enjoyments through being estranged from them by the fault of their destiny,āhāraśuddhyā yadi puṇyamiṣṭaṁ tasmānmṛgāṇāmapi puṇyamasti |ye cāpi bāhyāḥ puruṣāḥ phalebhyo bhāgyāparādhena parāṅmukhatvāt || 728
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 29 If the deliberate choice of pain is a cause of merit why should not that same choice be directed to pleasure If you say that the choice of pleasure carries no authority is not the choice of pain equally without authority,duḥkhe bhisaṁdhistvatha puṇyahetuḥ sukhe pi kāryo nanu so bhisaṁdhiḥ |atha pramāṇaṁ na sukhe bhisaṁdhirduḥkhe pramāṇaṁ nanu nābhisaṁdhiḥ || 729
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 30 So too those who for the sake of purifying their actions earnestly sprinkle water on themselves saying this is a sacred spot — even there this satisfaction resides only in the heart — for waters will not cleanse away sin,tathaiva ye karmaviśuddhihetoḥ spṛśaṁtyapastīrthamiti pravṛttāḥ |tatrāpi toṣo hṛdi kevalo yaṁ na pāvayiṣyaṁti hi pāpamāpaḥ || 730
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 31 The water which has been touched by the virtuous — that is the spot if you wish for a sacred spot on the earth therefore I count as a place of pilgrimage only the virtues of a virtuous man’ 07 — water without doubt is only water’,spṛṣṭaṁ hi yadyadguṇavadbhiraṁbhastattatpṛthivyāṁ yadi tīrthamiṣṭam |tasmādguṇāneva paraimi tīrthamāpastu niḥsaṁśayamāpa eva || 731
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 32 Thus he uttered his discourse full of various arguments and the sun went down into the west then he entered the grove where penances had now ceased and whose trees were gray with the smoke of the (evening) oblations,iti sma tattadbahuyuktiyuktaṁ jagāda cāstaṁ ca yayau vivasvān |tato havirdhūmavivarṇavṛkṣaṁ tapaḥpraśāṁtaṁ sa vanaṁ viveśa || 732
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 33 Where the sacred fires had been duly transferred when kindled to other spots — all crowded with the holy hermits who had performed their ablutions and with the shrines of the gods murmuring with the muttered prayers — it seemed all alive like the full service of religion in exercise,abhyuddhṛtaprajvalitāgnihotraṁ kṛtābhiṣekarṣijanāvakīrṇam |jāpyasvanākūjitadevakoṣṭhaṁ dharmasya karmāṁtamiva pravṛttam || 733
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 34 He spent several nights there himself like the moon examining their penances and he departed from that penance-field feeling that he had comprehended the whole nature of penance,kāścinniśāstatra niśākarābhaḥ parīkṣamāṇaśca tapāṁsyuvāsa |sarvaṁ parikṣepya tapaśca matvā tasmāttapaḥkṣetratalājjagāma || 734
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 35 The dwellers of the hermitage followed him with their minds fixed on the greatness of soul visible in his person as if they were great seers beholding Religion herself withdrawn from a land invaded by the base,anvavrajannāśramiṇastatastaṁ tadrūpamāhātmyagatairmanobhiḥ |deśādanāryairabhibhūyamānānmahārṣayo dharmamivāpayāṁtam || 735
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 36 Then he looked on all those ascetics with their matted hair bark garments and rag-strips waving and he stood considering their penances under an auspicious and noble tree by the way-side,tato jaṭāvalkalacīrakhelāṁstapodhanāṁścaiva sa tāndadarśa |tapāṁsi caiṣāmanubudhyamānastasthau śive śrīmati mārgavṛkṣe || 736
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 37 Then the hermits having approached stood surrounding the best of men and an old man from among them thus addressed him respectfully in a gentle voice,athopasṛtyāśramavāsinastaṁ manuṣyavaryaṁ parivārya tasthuḥ |vṛddhaśca teṣāṁ bahumānapūrvaṁ kalena sāmnā giramityuvāca || 737
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 38 At thy coming the hermitage seems to have become full it becomes as it were empty when thou art gone — therefore my son thou wilt not surely desert it as the loved life the body of one who wishes to live,tvayyāgate pūrṇa ivāśramo bhūtsaṁpadyate śūnya iva prayāte |tasmādimaṁ nārhasi tāta hātuṁ jijīviṣordehamiveṣṭamāyuḥ || 738
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 39 In front stands the holy mountain Himavat inhabited by Brahmarṣis rājarṣis and surarṣis by whose mere presence the merit of these penances becomes multiplied to the ascetics,brahmarṣirājarṣisurarṣijuṣṭaḥ puṇyaḥ samīpe himavān hi śailaḥ |tapāṁsi tānyeva tapodhanānāṁ yatsaṁnikarṣādbahulībhavaṁti || 739
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 40 Near us also are holy spots of pilgrimage which become ladders to heaven loved by divine sages and saints whose souls are intent on devotion and who keep their souls in perfect control,tīrthāni puṇyānyabhitastathaiva sopānabhūtāni nabhastalasya |juṣṭāni dharmātmabhirātmavadbhirdevarṣibhiścaiva mahārṣibhiśca || 740
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 41 From hence again the Northern quarter is especially to be fitly followed for the sake of preeminent merit even one who was wise starting towards the south could not advance one single step,itaśca bhūyaḥ kṣamamuttaraiva diksevituṁ dharmaviśeṣahetoḥ |na hi kṣamaṁ dakṣiṇato budhena padaṁ bhavedekamapi prayātum || 741
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 42 Hast thou seen in this sacred grove one who neglects all ceremonies or who follows confused ceremonies or an outcast or one impure that thou dost not desire to dwell here Speak it out and let the abode be welcomed,tapovane sminnatha niṣkriyo vā saṁkīrṇadharmā patito śucirvā |dṛṣṭastvayā yena na te vivatsā tadbrūhi yāvadrucito stu vāsaḥ || 742
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 43 These hermits here desire thee as their companion in penance thee who art like a storehouse of penance — to dwell with thee who art like Indra would bring prosperity even to Vṛhaspati’,ime hi vāṁchaṁti tapaḥsahāyaṁ taponidhānapratimaṁ bhavaṁtam |vāsastvayā hīṁdrasamena sārdhaṁ vṛhaspaterabhyudayāvahaḥ syāt || 743
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 44 He the chief of the wise when thus addressed in the midst of the ascetics by their chief—having resolved in his mind to put an end to all existence — thus uttered his inward thought,ityevamukte sa tapasvimadhye tapasvimukhyena manīṣimukhyaḥ |bhavapraṇāśāya kṛtapratijñaḥ svaṁ bhāvamaṁtargatamācacakṣe || 744
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 45 The upright-souled saints the upholders of religion become the very ideal of our own kindred through their delight in showing hospitality by all these kind feelings of thine towards me affection is produced in me and the path which regards the self as supreme 08 is revealed,ṛjvātmanāṁ dharmabhṛtāṁ munīnāmiṣṭātithitvātsvajanopamānam |evaṁvidhairmāṁ prati bhāvajātaiḥ prītiḥ parātmā janitaśca mārgaḥ || 745
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 46 I seem to be all at once bathed by these gentle heart-touching words of thine and the joy now throbs in me once more which I felt when I first grasped the idea of dharma,snigdhābhirābhirhṛdayaṁgamābhiḥ samāsataḥ snāta ivāsmi vāgbhiḥ |ratiśca me dharmanavagrahasya vispaṁditā saṁprati bhūya eva || 746
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 47 There is sorrow to me when I reflect that I shall have to depart leaving you who are thus engaged you who are such a refuge and who have shown such excessive kindness to me — just as there was when I had to leave my kindred behind,evaṁ pravṛttān bhavataḥ śaraṇyānatīva saṁdarśitapakṣapātān |yāsyāmi hitveti mamāpi duḥkhaṁ yathaiva baṁdhūṁstyajatastathaiva || 747
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 48 But this devotion of yours is for the sake of heaven — while my desire is that there may be no fresh birth therefore I wish not to dwell in this wood the nature of cessation is different from that of activity,svargāya yuṣmākamayaṁ tu dharmo mamābhilāṣastvapunarbhavāya |asmin vane yena na me vivatsā bhinnaḥ pravṛttyā hi nivṛttidharmaḥ || 748
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 49 It is not therefore any dislike on my part or the wrong conduct of another which makes me go away from this wood for ye are all like great sages standing fast in the religious duties which are in accordance with former ages’,tannāratirme na parāpacāro vanādito yena parivrajāmi |dharme sthitāḥ pūrvayugānurūpe sarve bhavaṁto hi mahārṣikalpāḥ || 749
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 50 Then having heard the prince’s discourse gracious and of deep meaning gentle strong and full of dignity the ascetics paid him especial honour,tato vacaḥ sūnṛtamarthavacca suślakṣṇamojasvi ca garvitaṁ ca |śrutvā kumārasya tapasvinaste viśeṣayuktaṁ bahumānamīyuḥ || 750
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 51 But a certain Brāhman who was lying there in the ashes tall and wearing his hair in a tuft and clothed in the bark of trees with reddish eyes and a thin long nose and carrying a pot with water 09 in his hand thus lifted his voice,kaściddvijastatra tu bhasmaśāyī prāṁśuḥ śikhī dāravacīravāsāḥ |āpiṁgalākṣastanudīrghaghoṇaḥ kuṁḍodahasto giramityuvāca || 751
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 52 O sage brave indeed is thy purpose who young as thou art hast seen the evils of birth he who having pondered thoroughly heaven and liberation makes up his mind for liberation — he is indeed brave,dhīmannudāraḥ khalu niścayaste yastvaṁ yuvā janmani dṛṣṭadoṣaḥ |svargāpavargau hi vicārya samyagyasyāpavarge matirasti so sti || 752
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 53 By all those various sacrifices penances and vows the slaves of passion desire to go to heaven but the strong having battled with passion as with an enemy desire to obtain liberation,yajñaistapobhirniyamaiśca taistaiḥ svargaṁ yiyāsaṁti hi rāgavaṁtaḥ |rāgeṇa sārdhaṁ ripuṇeva yuddhvā mokṣaṁ parīpsaṁti tu sattvavaṁtaḥ || 753
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 54 If this is thy settled purpose go quickly to Viṁdhyakoṣṭha the Muni Arāḍa lives there who has gained an insight into absolute bliss,tadbuddhireṣā yadi niścitā te tūrṇaṁ bhavān gacchatu viṁdhyakoṣṭham |asau munistatra vasatyarāḍo yo naiṣṭhike śreyasi labdhacakṣuḥ || 754
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 55 From him thou wilt hear the path to truth and if thou hast a desire for it thou wilt embrace it but as I foresee this purpose of thine will go on further after having rejected his theory,tasmādbhavāñchroṣyati tattvamārgaṁ satyāṁ rucau saṁpratipatsyate ca |yathā tu paśyāmi matistavaiṣā tasyāpi yāsyatyavadhūya buddhim || 755
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 56 With the nose of a well-fed horse large long eyes a red lower lip white sharp teeth and a thin red tongue — this face of thine will drink up the entire ocean of what is to be known,puṣṭāśvaghoṇaṁ vipulāyatākṣaṁ tāmrādharoṣṭhaṁ sitatīkṣṇadaṁṣṭram |idaṁ hi vaktraṁ tanuraktajihvaṁ jñeyārṇavaṁ pāsyati kṛtsnameva || 756
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 57 That unfathomed depth which characterises thee that majesty and all those signs of thine — they shall win a teacher’s chair in the earth which was never won by sages even in a former age’,gaṁbhīratā yā bhavatastvagādhā yā dīptatā yāni ca lakṣaṇāni |ācāryakaṁ prāpsyasi tatpṛthivyāṁ yannarṣibhiḥ pūrvayuge pyavāptam || 757
https//bitly/2jICUB6, 58 The prince replied Very well’ and having saluted the company of sages he departed the hermits also having duly performed to him all the rites of courtesy entered again into the ascetic grove,paramamiti tato nṛpātmajastamṛṣijanaṁ pratinaṁdya niryayau |vidhivadanuvidhāya te pi taṁ praviviśurāśramiṇastapovanam || 758
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 1 Meanwhile the attendant of the horse in deep distress when his unselfish master thus went into the forest made every effort in the road to dissolve 01 his load of sorrow and yet in spite of it all not a tear dropped from him,tatasturaṁgāvacaraḥ sa durmanāstathā vanaṁ bhartari nirmame gate |cakāra yatnaṁ pathi śokavigrahe tathāpi caivāśru na tasya cikṣipe || 81
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 2 But the road which by his lord’s command he had traversed in one night with that horse — that same road he now travelled in eight days pondering his lord’s absence,yamekarātreṇa tu bharturājñayā jagāma mārgaṁ saha tena vājinā |iyāya bharturvirahaṁ viciṁtayaṁstameva paṁthānamahobhiraṣṭabhiḥ || 82
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 3 And the horse Kaṁthaka though he still went on bravely flagged and had lost all spirit in his heart and decked though he was with ornaments he had lost all his beauty when bereft of his master,hayaśca saujasvi cacāra kaṁthakastatāma bhāvena babhūva nirmadaḥ |alaṁkṛtaścāpi tathaiva bhūṣaṇairabhūdgataśrīriva tena varjitaḥ || 83
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 4 And turning round towards that ascetic-grove he neighed repeatedly with a mournful sound and though pressed with hunger he welcomed not nor tasted any grass or water on the road as before 02,nivṛtya caivābhimukhastapovanaṁ bhṛśaṁ jiheṣe karuṇaṁ muhurmuhuḥ |kṣudhānvito pyadhvani śaṣpamaṁbu vā yathā purā nābhinanaṁda nādade || 84
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 5 Slowly they two at last came back to the city called after Kapila which seemed empty when deserted by that hero who was bent on the salvation of the world — like the sky bereft of the sun,tato vihīnaṁ kapilāhvayaṁ puraṁ mahātmanā tena jagaddhitātmanā |krameṇa tau śūnyamivopajagmaturdivākareṇeva vinākṛtaṁ nabhaḥ || 85
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 6 Bright as it was with lotus-covered waters adorned also with trees full of flowers that garden of his which was now like a forest was no longer gay with citizens who had lost all their gladness,sapuṁḍarīkairapi śobhitaṁ jalairalaṁkṛtaṁ puṣpadharairnagairapi |tadeva tasyopavanaṁ vanopamaṁ gatapraharṣairna rarāja nāgaraiḥ || 86
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 7 Then those two — who were as it were silently forbidden by the sad inhabitants who were wandering in that direction their brightness gone and their eyes dim with tears — slowly entered the city which seemed all bathed in gloom,tato bhramadbhirdiśi dīnamānasairanujjvalairvāṣpahatekṣaṇairnaraiḥ |nivāryamāṇāviva tāvubhau puraṁ śanairajaḥsnātamivābhijagmatuḥ || 87
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 8 Having heard that they had returned with their limbs all relaxed coming back without the pride of the Śākya race the men of the city shed tears in the road as when in old days the chariot of the son of Daśaratha came back,niśamya ca srastaśarīragāminau vināgatau śākyakularṣabheṇa tau |mumoca vāṣpaṁ pathi nāgaro janaḥ purā rathe dāśaratherivāgate || 88
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 9 Full of wrath the people followed Chaṁdaka in the road crying behind him with tears Where is the king’s son the glory of his race and kingdom he has been stolen away by thee’,atha bruvaṁtaḥ samupetamanyavo janāḥ pathi cchaṁdakamāgatāśravaḥ |kva rājaputraḥ kularāṣṭravardhano hṛtastvayāsāviti pṛṣṭhato nvayuḥ || 89
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 10 Then he said to those faithful ones I have not left the king’s son but by him in the uninhabited forest I weeping and the dress of a householder were abandoned together’,tataḥ sa tān bhaktimato bravījjanānnareṁdraputraṁ na parityajāmyaham |rudannahaṁ tena tu nirjane vane gṛhasthaveśaśca visarjitāviti || 810
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 11 Having heard these words of his those crowds adopted a most difficult resolve they did not wipe away the tears which fell from their eyes and they blamed their own (evil) hearts on account of the consequences of their actions,idaṁ vacastasya niśamya te janāḥ suduṣkaraṁ khalviti niścayaṁ yayuḥ |patadvijahruḥ salilaṁ na netrajaṁ mano niniṁduśca phalārthamātmanaḥ || 811
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 12 Then they said Let us go this very day into that forest whither he is gone whose gait is like the king of elephants without him we have no wish to live like the senses when the souls depart,athocuradyaiva viśāma tadvanaṁ gataḥ sa yatra dviparājavikramaḥ |jijīviṣā nāsti hi tena no vinā yatheṁdriyāṇāṁ vigame śarīriṇām || 812
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 13 This city bereft of him is a forest and that forest which possesses him is a city the city without him has no charms for us like heaven without the lord of the Maruts when Vṛtra was slain’ 03,idaṁ puraṁ tena vivarjitaṁ vanaṁ vanaṁ ca tattena samanvitaṁ puram |na śobhate tena hi no vinā puraṁ marutvatā vṛtravadhe yathā divam || 813
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 14 Next the women crowded to the rows of windows crying to one another The prince has returned’ but having heard that his horse had an empty back they closed the windows again and wailed aloud,punaḥ kumāro vinivṛtta ityathau gavākṣamālāḥ pratipedire ṁganāḥ |viviktapṛṣṭhaṁ ca niśamya vājinaṁ punargavākṣāṇi pidhāya cukruśuḥ || 814
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 15 But the king having undertaken religious observances for the recovery of his son with his mind distressed by the vow and the sorrow was muttering prayers in the temple and performing such rites as suited the occasion,praviṣṭadīkṣastu sutopalabdhaye vratena śokena ca khinnamānasaḥ |jajāpa devāyatane narādhipaścakāra tāstāśca yathāśrayāḥ kriyāḥ || 815
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 16 Then with his eyes filled with tears — taking the horse his whole soul fixed on the horse — overcome with grief he 04 entered the palace as if his master had been killed by an enemy,tataḥ sa vāṣpapratipūrṇalocanasturaṁgamādāya turaṁgamānasaḥ | 816viveśa śokābhihato nṛpālayaṁ kṣayaṁ vinīte ripuṇeva bhartari ||
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 17 And entering the royal stable looking about with his eyes full of tears Kaṁthaka uttered a loud sound as if he were uttering his woe to the people,vigāhamānaśca nareṁdramaṁdiraṁ vilokayannaśruvahena cakṣuṣā |svareṇa puṣṭena rurāva kaṁthako janāya duḥkhaṁ prativedayanniva || 817
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 18 Then the birds that fed in the middle of the house and the carefully cherished horses that were tied near by re-echoed the sound of that horse thinking that it might be the return of the prince,tataḥ khagāśca kṣayamadhyagocarāḥ samīpabaddhāsturagāśca satkṛtāḥ |hayasya tasya pratisasvanuḥ svanaṁ nareṁdrasūnorupayānaśaṁkitāḥ || 818
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 19 And the people deceived by an excessive joy who were in the neighbourhood of the king’s inner apartments thought in their hearts Since the horse Kaṁthaka neighs it must be that the prince is coming’,janāśca harṣātiśayena vaṁcitā janādhipāṁtaḥpurasaṁnikarṣagāḥ |yathā hayaḥ kaṁthaka eṣa heṣate dhruvaṁ kumāro viśatīti menire || 819
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 20 Then the women who were fainting with sorrow now in wild joy with their eyes rolling to see the prince rushed out of the palace full of hope like flickering lightnings from an autumn cloud,atipraharṣādatha śokamūrchitāḥ kumārasaṁdarśanalolalocanāḥ |gṛhādviniścakramurāśayā striyaḥ śaratpayodādiva vidyutaścalāḥ || 820
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 21 With their dress hanging down and their linen garments soiled their faces untouched by collyrium and with eyes dimmed by tears dark and discoloured and destitute of all painting 05 like the stars in the sky pale-red with the ending of night,vilaṁbaveśyo malināṁśukāṁbarā niraṁjanairvāṣpahatekṣaṇairmukhaiḥ |kṛṣṇā vivarṇāṁjanayā vinākṛtā divīva tārā rajanīkṣayāruṇāḥ || 821
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 22 With their feet unstained by red and undecked by anklets — their faces without earrings and their ears in their native simplicity — their loins with only nature’s fulness and uncircled by any girdle — and their bosoms bare of strings of pearls as if they had been robbed,araktatāmraiścaraṇairanūpurairakuṁḍalairārjavakarṇikairmukhaiḥ |svabhāvapīnairjaghanairamekhalairahārayoktrairmuṣitairiva stanaiḥ || 822
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 23 But when they saw Chaṁdaka standing helpless his eyes filled with tears and the horse the noble women wept with pale faces like cows abandoned by the bull in the midst of the forest,nirīkṣitā vāṣpaparītalocanaṁ nirāśrayaṁ chaṁdakamaśvameva ca |vivarṇavaktrā rurudurvarāṁganā vanāṁtare gāva ivarṣabhojjhitāḥ || 823
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 24 Then the king’s principal queen Gautamī like a fond cow that has lost her calf fell bursting into tears on the ground with outstretched arms like a golden plantain-tree with trembling leaves,tataḥ savāṣpā mahiṣī mahīpateḥ pranaṣṭavatsā mahiṣīva vatsalā |pragṛhya bāhū nipapāta gautamī vilolaparṇā kadalīva kāṁcanī || 824
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 25 Some of the other women bereft of their brightness and with arms and souls lifeless and seeming to have lost their senses in their despondency raised no cry shed no tear and breathed not standing senseless as if painted 06,hatatviṣo nyāḥ śithilātmabāhavaḥ striyo viṣādena vicetanā iva |na cukruśurnāśru jahurna śaśvasurna cetanā ullikhitā iva sthitāḥ || 825
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 26 Others as having lost all self-control fainting in their sorrow for their lord their faces pouring tears from their eyes watered their bosoms from which all sandal-wood was banished like a mountain the rocks with its streams,adhīramanyāḥ patiśokamūrchitā vilocanaprasravaṇairmukhaiḥ striyaḥ |siṣiṁcire proṣitacaṁdanān stanān dharādharaḥ prasravaṇairivopalān || 826
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 27 Then that royal palace was illumined with their faces pelted by the tears from their eyes as a lake in the time of the first rains with its dripping lotuses pelted by the rain from the clouds,mukhaiśca tāsāṁ nayanāṁbutāḍitaiḥ rarāja tadrājaniveśanaṁ tadā |navāṁbukāle ṁbudavṛṣṭitāḍitaiḥ sravajjalaistāmarasairyathā saraḥ || 827
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 28 The noble women beat their breasts with their lotus-like hands falling incessantly whose fingers were round and plump which had their arteries hidden and bore no ornaments — as creepers tossed by the wind strike themselves with their shoots,suvṛttapīnāṁgulibhirniraṁtarairabhūṣaṇairgūḍhaśirairvarāṁganāḥ |urāṁsi jaghnuḥ kamalopamaiḥ karaiḥ svapallavairvātacalā latā iva || 828
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 29 And again how those women shine forth as their bosoms rose up together after the blow from the hand and trembled with the shock like the streams when their pairs of ruddy geese shake as the lotuses on which they sit wave about with the wind from the wood 07,karaprahārapracalaiśca tā babhuryathāpi nāryaḥ sahitonnataiḥ stanaiḥ |vanānilāghūrṇitapadmakaṁpitaiḥ rathāṁganāmnāṁ mithunairivāpagāḥ || 829
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 30 As they pressed their breasts with their hands so too they pressed their hands with their breasts — dull to all feelings of pity they made their hands and bosoms inflict mutual pains on each other,yathā ca vakṣāṁsi karairapīḍayaṁstathaiva vakṣobhirapīḍayan karān |akārayaṁstatra parasparaṁ vyathāḥ karāgravakṣāṁsyabalā dayālasāḥ || 830
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 31 Then thus spoke Yaśodharā shedding tears with deep 08 sorrow her bosom heaving with her sighs her eyes discoloured with aneer and her voice choking with emotion through the influence of despondency,tatastu roṣapraviraktalocanā viṣādasaṁbaṁdhakaṣāyagadgadam |uvāca niḥśvāsacalatpayodharā vigādhaśokāśrudharā yaśodharā || 831
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 32 Leaving me helplessly asleep in the night whither O Chaṁdaka is he the desire of my heart gone and when thou and Kaṁthaka are alone come back while three went away together my mind trembles,niśi prasuptāmavaśāṁ vihāya māṁ gataḥ kva sa cchaṁdaka manmanorathaḥ |upāgate ca tvayi kaṁthake ca me samaṁ gateṣu triṣu kaṁpate manaḥ || 832
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 33 Why dost thou weep to-day O cruel one having done a dishonourable pitiless and unfriendly deed to me Cease thy tears and be content in thy heart — tears and that deed of thine ill agree,anāryamasnidghamamitrakarma me nṛśaṁsa kṛtvā kimihādya rodiṣi |niyaccha vāṣpaṁ bhava tuṣṭamānaso na saṁvadatyaśru ca tacca karma te || 833
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 34 Through thee his dear obedient faithful loyal companion always doing what was right the son of my lord is gone never to return — rejoice — all hail thy pains have gained their end,priyeṇa vaśyena hitena sādhunā tvayā sahāyena yathārthakāriṇā |gato ryaputro hyapunarnivṛttaye ramasva diṣṭyā saphalaḥ śramastava || 834
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 35 Better for a man a wise enemy rather than a foolish friend unskilled in emergencies by thee the unwise self-styled friend a great calamity has been brought upon this family,varaṁ manuṣyasya vicakṣaṇo ripurna mitramaprājñamayogapeśalam |suhṛdbruveṇa hyavipaścitā tvayā kṛtaḥ kulasyāsya mahānupaplavaḥ || 835
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 36 These women are sorely to be pitied who have put away their ornaments having their eyes red and dimmed with continuous tears who are as it were desolate widows though their lord still stands as unshaken as the earth or Mount Himavat,imā hi śocyā vyavamuktabhūṣaṇāḥ prasaktavāṣpāvilaraktalocanāḥ |sthite pi patyau himavanmahīsame pranaṣṭaśobhā vidhavā iva striyaḥ || 836
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 37 And these lines of palaces seem to weep aloud flinging up their dovecots for arms with the long unbroken moan of their doves — separated verily with him from all who could restrain them,imāśca vikṣiptaviṭaṁkabāhavaḥ prasaktapārāvatadīrghanisvanāḥ |vinākṛtāstena sahaiva rodhanairbhṛśaṁ rudaṁtīva vimānapaṁktayaḥ || 837
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 38 Even that horse Kaṁthaka without doubt desired my utter ruin for he bore away from hence my treasure when all were sound asleep in the night — like one who steals jewels,anarthakāmo sya janasya sarvathā turaṁgamo pi dhruvameṣa kaṁthakaḥ |jahāra sarvasvamitastathā hi me jane prasupte niśi ratnacauravat || 838
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 39 When he was able to bear even the onsets of arrows and still more the strokes of whips — how then for fear of the fall of a whip could he go carrying with him my prosperity and my heart together,yadā samarthaḥ khalu soḍhumāgatāniṣuprahārānapi kiṁ punaḥ kaśāḥ |gataḥ kaśāpātabhayāt kathaṁ tvayaṁ śriyaṁ gṛhītvā hṛdayaṁ ca me samam || 839
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 40 The base creature now neighs loudly filling the king’s palace with the sound but when he carried away my beloved then this vilest of horses was dumb,anāryakarmā bhṛśamadya heṣate nareṁdradhiṣṇyaṁ pratipūrayanniva |yadā tu nirvāhayati sma me priyaṁ tadā hi mūkasturagādhamo bhavat || 840
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 41 If he had neighed and so woke up the people or had even made a noise with his hoofs on the ground or had made the loudest sound he could with his jaws my grief would not have been so great’,yadi hyaheṣiṣyata bodhayañjanaṁ khuraiḥ kṣitau vāpyakariṣyata dhvanim |hanusvanaṁ vājanayiṣyaduttamaṁ na cābhaviṣyanmama duḥkhamīdṛśam || 841
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 42 Having thus heard the queen’s words their syllables choked with tears and full of lament slowly Chaṁdaka uttered this answer with his face bent down his voice low with tears and his hands clasped in supplication,itīha devyāḥ paridevitāśrayaṁ niśamya vāṣpagrathitākṣaraṁ vacaḥ |adhomukhaḥ sāśrukalaḥ kṛtāṁjaliḥ śanairidaṁ chaṁdaka uttaraṁ jagau || 842
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 43 Surely O queen thou wilt not blame Kaṁthaka nor wilt thou show thy anger against me know that we two are entirely guiltless — that god amongst men O queen is gone away like a god,vigarhituṁ nārhasi devi kaṁthakaṁ na cāpi roṣaṁ mayi kartumarhasi |anāgasau svaḥ samavehi sarvaśo gato nṛdevaḥ sa hi devi devavat || 843
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 44 I indeed though I well knew the king’s command as though dragged by force by some divine powers brought quickly to him this swift steed and followed him on the road unwearied,ahaṁ hi jānannapi rājaśāsanaṁ balātkṛtaḥ kairapi daivatairiva |upānayaṁ tūrṇamimaṁ turaṁgamaṁ tathānvagacchaṁ vigataśramo dhvani || 844
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 45 And this best of horses as he went along touched not the ground with the tips of his hoofs as if they were kept aloft from it and so too having his mouth restrained as by fate he made no sound with his jaws and neighed not,vrajannayaṁ vājivaro pi nāspṛśanmahīṁ khurāgrairvidhṛtairivāṁtarā |tathaiva daivādiva saṁyatānano hanusvanaṁ nākṛta nāpyaheṣata || 845
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 46 When the prince went out then the gate was thrown open of its own accord and the darkness of the night was as it were pierced by the sun — we may learn from hence too that this was the ordering of fate,yadā vahirgacchati pārthivātmajastadābhavaddvāramapāvṛtaṁ svayam |tamaśca naiśaṁ raviṇeva pāṭitaṁ tato pi daivo vidhireṣa gṛhyatām || 846
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 47 When also by the king’s command in palace and city diligent guards had been placed by thousands and at that time they were all overcome by sleep and woke not — we may learn from hence too that this was the ordering of fate,yadāpramatto pi nareṁdraśāsanādgṛhe pure caiva sahasraśo janaḥ |tadā sa nābudhyata nidrayā hṛtastato pi daivo vidhireṣa gṛhyatām || 847
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 48 When also the garment approved for a hermit’s dwelling in the forest was offered to him at the moment by some denizen of heaven and the tiara which he threw into the sky was carried off — we may learn from hence too that this was the ordering of fate,yataśca vāso vanavāsasaṁmataṁ visṛṣṭamasmai samaye divaukasā |divi praviddhaṁ mukuṭaṁ ca taddhṛtaṁ tato pi daivo vidhireṣa gṛhyatām || 848
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 49 Do not therefore assume 09 that his departure arises from the fault of either of us O queen neither I nor this horse acted by our own choice he went on his way with the gods as his retinue’,tadevamāvāṁ naradevi doṣato na tatprayātaṁ pratigaṁtumarhasi |na kāmakāro mama nāsya vājinaḥ kṛtānuyātraḥ sa hi daivatairgataḥ || 849
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 50 Having thus heard the history of the prince’s departure so marvellous in many ways those women as though losing their grief were filled with wonder but they again took up their distress at the thought of his becoming an ascetic,iti prayāṇaṁ bahudhaivamadbhutaṁ niśamya tāstasya mahātmanaḥ striyaḥ |pranaṣṭaśokā iva vismayaṁ yayurmanojvaraṁ pravrajanāttu lebhire || 850
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 51 With her eyes filled with the tears of despondency wretched like an osprey who has lost her young — Gautamī abandoning all self-control wailed aloud — she fainted and with a weeping face exclaimed,viṣādapāriplavalocanā tataḥ pranaṣṭapotā kurarīva duḥkhitā |vihāya dhairyaṁ virurāva gautamī tatāma caivāśrumukhī jagāda ca || 851

https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 53 With his long arms and lion-gait his bull-like eye and his beauty bright like gold his broad chest and his voice deep as a drum or a cloud should such a hero as this dwell in a hermitage,pralaṁbabāhurmṛgarājavikramo mahārṣabhākṣaḥ kanakojjvaladyutiḥ |viśālavakṣā ghanaduṁdubhisvanastathāvidho pyāśramavāsamarhati || 853
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 54 This earth is indeed unworthy as regards that peerless doer of noble actions for such a virtuous hero has gone away from her — it is the merits and virtues of the subjects which produce their king,abhāginī nūnamiyaṁ vasuṁdharā tamāryakarmāṇamanuttamaṁ prati |gatastato sau guṇavān hi tādṛśo nṛpaḥ prajābhāgyaguṇaiḥ prasūyate || 854
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 55 Those two feet of his tender with their beautiful web spread between the toes with their ankles concealed and soft like a blue lotus — how can they bearing a wheel marked in the middle walk on the hard ground of the skirts of the forest,sujātajālāvatatāṁgulī mṛdū nigūḍhagulphau viṣapuṣpakomalau |vanāṁtabhūmiṁ kaṭhināṁ kathaṁ nu tau sacakramadhyau caraṇau gamiṣyataḥ || 855
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 56 That body which deserves to sit or lie on the roof of a palace — honoured with costly garments aloes and sandal-wood — how will that manly body live in the woods exposed to the attacks of the cold the heat and the rain,vimānapṛṣṭhe śayanāsanocitaṁ mahārhavastrāgurucaṁdanārcitam |kathaṁ nu śītoṣṇajalāgameṣu taccharīramojasvi vane bhaviṣyati || 856
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 57 He who was proud of his family goodness strength energy sacred learning beauty and youth — who was ever ready to give not to ask — how will he go about begging alms from others,kulena sattvena balena varcasā śrutena lakṣmyā vayasā ca garvitaḥ |pradātumevābhyudito na yācituṁ kathaṁ sa bhikṣāṁ parataścariṣyati || 857
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 58 He who lying on a spotless golden bed was awakened during the night by the concert of musical instruments — how alas will he my ascetic sleep to-day on the bare ground with only one rag of cloth interposed’,śucau śayitvā śayane hiraṇmaye prabodhyamāno niśi tūryanisvanaiḥ |kathaṁ vata svapsyati so dya me vratī paṭaukadeśāṁtarite mahītale || 858
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 59 Having heard this piteous lamentation the women embracing one another with their arms rained the tears from their eyes as the shaken creepers drop honey from their flowers,imaṁ vilāpaṁ karuṇaṁ niśamya tā bhujaiḥ pariṣvajya parasparaṁ striyaḥ |vilocanebhyaḥ salilāni tatyajurmadhūni puṣpebhya iveritā latāḥ || 859
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 60 Then Yaśodharā fell upon the ground like the ruddy goose parted from her mate and in utter bewilderment she slowly lamented with her voice repeatedly stopped by sobs,tato dharāyāmapatadyaśodharā vicakravākeva rathāṁgasāhvayā |śanaiśca tattadvilalāpa viklavā muhurmuhurgadgadaruddhayā girā || 860
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 61 If he wishes to practise a religious life after abandoning me his lawful wife widowed — where is his religion who wishes to follow penance without his lawful wife to share it with him,sa māmanāthāṁ sahadharmacāriṇīmapāsya dharmaṁ yadi kartumicchati |kuto sya dharmaḥ sahadharmacāriṇīṁ vinā tapo yaḥ paribhoktumicchati || 861
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 62 He surely has never heard of the monarchs of olden times his own ancestors Mahāsudarśa 10 and the rest — how they went with their wives into the forest — that he thus wishes to follow a religious life without me,śṛṇoti nūnaṁ sa na pūrvapārthivān mahāsudarśaprabhṛtīn pitāmahān |vanāni patnīsahitānupeyuṣastathā sa dharmaṁ madṛte cikīrṣati || 862
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 63 He does not see that husband and wife are both consecrated in sacrifices and both purified by the performance of the rites of the Veda and both destined to enjoy 11 the same results afterwards — he therefore grudges me a share in his merit,makheṣu vā vedavidhānasaṁskṛtau na daṁpatī paśyati dīkṣitāvubhau |samaṁ bubhukṣū parato pi tatphalaṁ tato sya jāto mayi dharmamatsaraḥ || 863
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 64 Surely it must be that this fond lover of religion knowing that my mind was secretly quarrelling even with my beloved lightly and without fear has deserted me thus angry in the hope to obtain heavenly nymphs in lndra’s world,dhruvaṁ sa jānan mama dharmavallabho manaḥ priye pyākalahaṁ muhurmithaḥ |sukhaṁ vibhīrmāmapahāya rosaṇāṁ maheṁdraloke psaraso jighṛkṣati || 864
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 65 But what kind of a thought is this of mine those women even there have the attributes which belong to bodies — for whose sake he thus practises austerities in the forest deserting his royal magnificence and my fond devotion,iyaṁ tu ciṁtā mama kīdṛśaṁ nu tā vapurguṇaṁ bibhrati tatra yoṣitaḥ |vane yadarthaṁ sa tapāṁsi tapyate śriyaṁ ca hitvā mama bhaktimeva ca || 865
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 66 I have no such longing for the joy of heaven nor is that hard for even common people to win if they are resolute 12 but my one desire is how he my beloved may never leave me either in this world or the next,na khalviyaṁ svargasukhāya me spṛhā na tajjanasyātmavato pi durlabham |sa tu priyo māmiha vā paratra vā kathaṁ na jahyāditi me manorathaḥ || 866
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 67 Even if I am unworthy to look on my husbands face with its long eyes and bright smile still is this poor Rāhula never to roll about in his father’s lap,abhāginī yadyahamāyatekṣaṇaṁ śucismitaṁ bharturudīkṣituṁ mukham |na maṁdabhāgyo rhati rāhulo pyayaṁ kadācidaṁke parivartituṁ pituḥ || 867
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 68 Alas the mind of that wise hero is terribly stern — gentle as his beauty seems it is pitilessly cruel — who can desert of his own accord such an infant son with his inarticulate talk one who would charm even an enemy,aho nṛśaṁsaṁ sukumāravarcasaḥ sudāruṇaṁ tasya manasvino manaḥ |kalapralāpaṁ dviṣato pi harṣaṇaṁ śiśuṁ sutaṁ yastyajatīdṛśaṁ svataḥ || 868
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 69 My heart too is certainly most stern yea made of rock or fashioned even of iron which does not break when its lord is gone to the forest deserted by his royal glory like an orphan — he so well worthy of happiness’,mamāpi kāmaṁ hṛdayaṁ sudāruṇaṁ śilāmayaṁ vāpyayasāpi vā kṛtam |anāthavacchrīrahite sukhocite vanaṁ gate bhartari yanna dīryate || 869
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 70 So the queen fainting in her woe wept and pondered and wailed aloud repeatedly — self-possessed as she was by nature yet in her distress she remembered not her fortitude and felt no shame,itīha devī patiśokamūrchitā ruroda dadhyau vilalāpa cāsakṛt |svabhāvadhīrāpi hi sā satī śucā dhṛtiṁ na sasmāra cakāra no hriyam || 870
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 71 Seeing Yaśodharā thus bewildered with her wild utterances of grief and fallen on the ground all the women cried out with their faces streaming with tears like large lotuses beaten by the rain,tatastathā śokavilāpaviklavāṁ yaśodharāṁ prekṣya vasuṁdharāgatām |mahāraviṁdairiva vṛṣṭitāḍitairmukhaiḥ savāṣpairvanitā vicukruśuḥ || 871
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 72 But the king having ended his prayers and performed the auspicious rites of the sacrifice now came out of the temple and being smitten by the wailing sound of the people he tottered like an elephant at the crash of a thunderbolt,samāptajāpyaḥ kṛtahomamaṁgalo nṛpastu devāyatanādviniryayau |janasya tenārttaraveṇa cāhataścacāla vajradhvanineva vāraṇaḥ || 872
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 73 Having heard (of the arrival) of both Chaṁdaka and Kaṁthaka and having learned the fixed resolve of his son the lord of the earth fell struck down by sorrow like the banner of Indra when the festival is over 13,niśāmya ca cchaṁdakakaṁthakāvubhau sutasya saṁśrutya ca niścayaṁ sthiram |papāta śokābhihato mahīpatiḥ śacīpatervṛtta ivotsave dhvajaḥ || 873
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 74 Then the king distracted by his grief for his son being held up for a moment by his attendants all of the same race gazed on the horse with his eyes filled with tears and then falling on the ground wailed aloud,tato muhūrtaṁ sutaśokamohito janena tulyābhijanena dhāritaḥ |nirīkṣya dṛṣṭyā jalapūrṇayā hayaṁ mahītalastho vilalāpa pārthivaḥ || 874
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 75 After having done many dear exploits for me in battle one great deed of cruelty O Kaṁthaka hast thou done — for by thee that dear son of mine dear for his every virtue has been tossed down in the wood dear as he was like a worthless thing,bahūni kṛtvā samare priyāṇi me mahattvayā kaṁthaka vipriyaṁ kṛtam |guṇapriyo yena vane sa me priyaḥ priyo pi sannapriyavat praceritaḥ || 875
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 76 Therefore either lead me to-day where he is or go quickly and bring him back again without him there is no life left to me as to one plunged in sickness without the true medicine,tadadya māṁ vā naya tatra yatra sa vraja drutaṁ vā punarenamānaya |ṛte hi tasmānmama nāsti jīvitaṁ vigāḍharogasya sadauṣadhādiva || 876
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 77 When Suvarṇaniṣṭhīvin was carried away by death it seemed impossible that Sṛṁjaya 14 should not die and shall I when my duty-loving son is gone fear to set my soul free like any coward,suvarṇaniṣṭhīvini mṛtyunā hṛte suduṣkaraṁ yanna mamāra sṛṁjayaḥ |ahaṁ punardharmaratau sute gate mumukṣurātmānamanātmavāniva || 877
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 78 How should not the mind of Manu himself be distracted when parted from his dear virtuous son 15 — (Manu) the son of Vivasvat who knew the higher and the lower the mighty lord of creatures the institutor of the ten chieftains 16,vibhordaśakṣatrakṛtaḥ prajāpateḥ parāparajñasya vivasvadātmanaḥ |priyeṇa putreṇa satā vinākṛtaṁ kathaṁ na muhyeddhi mano manorapi || 878
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 79 I envy the monarch that friend of Indra the wise son of king Aja 17 who when his son went into the forest went himself to heaven and dragged out no miserable life here with vain tears,ajasya rājñastanayāya dhīmate narādhipāyeṁdrasakhāya me spṛhā |gate vanaṁ yastanaye divaṁ gato na moghavāṣpaḥ kṛpaṇaṁ jijīva ha || 879
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 80 Describe to me O beloved one the court of that hermitage whither thou hast carried him who is as my funeral oblation of water these my vital airs are all ready to depart and are eager for it longing to drink it’,pracakṣva me bhadra tadāśramājiraṁ hṛtastvayā yatra sa me jalāṁjaliḥ |ime parīpsaṁti hi te pipāsavo mamāsavaḥ pretagatiṁ yiyāsavaḥ || 880
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 81 Thus the king in his grief for his separation from his son — losing all his innate firmness which was stedfast like the earth — loudly lamented as one distraught like Daśaratha a prey to his sorrow for Rāma,iti tanayaviyogajātaduḥkhaṁ kṣitisadṛśaṁ sahajaṁ vihāya dhairyam |daśaratha iva rāmaśokavaśyo bahu vilalāpa nṛpo visaṁjñakalpaḥ || 881
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 82 Then the wise counsellor endued with religious learning courtesy and virtue and the old family priest spoke to him as was befitting in these well-weighed words neither with their faces overwhelmed by grief nor yet wholly unmoved,śrutavinayaguṇānvitastatastaṁ matisacivaḥ pravayāḥ purohitaśca |avadhṛtamidamūcaturyathāvanna ca paritaptamukhau na cāpyaśokau || 882
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 83 Cease O noblest of men thy grief regain thy firmness — surely thou wilt not O firm hero shed tears like one of no self-control many kings on this earth have gone into the forests throwing away their royal pomp like a crushed wreath,tyaja naravara śokamehi dhairyaṁ kudhṛtirivārhasi dhīra nāśru moktum |srajamiva mṛditāmapāsya lakṣmīṁ bhuvi bahavo hi nṛpā vanānyatīyuḥ || 883
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 84 Moreover this his state of mind was all predetermined remember those words long ago of the holy sage Asita He will never be made to dwell even for a moment contentedly in heaven or in an emperor’s domain,api ca niyata eṣa tasya bhāvaḥ smara vacanaṁ tadṛṣeḥ purāsitasya |na hi sa divi na cakravartirājye kṣaṇamapi vāsayituṁ sukhena śakyaḥ || 884
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 85 But if O best of men the effort must be made quickly speak the word we two will at once go together let the battle be waged in every way with thy son and his fate whatever it be’,yadi tu nṛvara kārya eva yatnastvaritamudāhara yāvadatra yāvaḥ |bahuvidhamiha yuddhamastu tāvattava tanayasya vidheśca tasya tasya || 885
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 86 Then the king commanded them both Do you both go quickly hence — my heart will not return to quiet any more than a bird’s in the woods longing for its young’,narapatiratha tau śaśāsa tasmāddrutamita eva yuvāmabhiprayātam |na hi mama hṛdayaṁ prayāti śāṁtiṁ vanaśakuneriva putralālasasya || 886
https//bitly/2vH1mn6, 87 With a prompt acquiescence at the king’s order the counsellor and the family priest went to that forest and then with his wives and his queen the king also saying It is done’ performed the remainder of the rites,paramamiti nareṁdraśāsanāttau yayaturamātyapurohitau vanaṁ tat |kṛtamiti savadhūjanaḥ sadāro nṛpatirapi pracakāra śeṣakāryam || 887
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 1 Then the two the counsellor and the family priest beaten by the king with his scourge of tears went with every effort to that forest in the hurry of affection like two noble horses goaded,tatastadā maṁtripurohitau tau vāṣpapratodābhihatau nṛpeṇa |viddhau sadaśvāviva sarvayatnātsauhārdaśīghraṁ yayaturvanaṁ tat || 91
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 2 Having come at last full of weariness to that hermitage accompanied by a fitting train — they dismissed their royal pomp and with sober gestures entered the abode of Bhārgava,tamāśramam jātapariśramau tāvupetya kāle sadṛśānuyātrau |rājarddhimutsṛjya vinītaceṣṭāvupeyaturbhārgavadhiṣṇyameva || 92
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 3 Having saluted that Brāhman with due respect and having been honoured by him with due reverence in return having seated themselves plunging at once into the subject they addressed Bhārgava who was likewise seated concerning their errand,tau nyāyatastaṁ pratipūjya vipraṁ tenārcitau tāvapi cānurūpam |kṛtāsanau bhārgavamāsanasthaṁ chittvā kathāmūcaturātmakṛtyam || 93
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 4 Let your honour know us to be respectively imperfect proficients in preserving the sacred learning and in retaining the state-counsels — in the service of the monarch of the Ikṣvāku race pure in his valour and pure and wide in his glory,śuddhaujasaḥ śuddhaviśālakīrterikṣvākuvaṁśaprabhavasya rājñaḥ |imaṁ janaṁ vettu bhavānadhīraṁ śrutagrahe maṁtraparigrahe ca || 94

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 6 He answered them That prince of the long arms did indeed come here but not as one unawakened this dharma only brings us back again — recognising this he went off forthwith towards Arāḍa seeking liberation’,tau so bravīdasti sa dīrghabāhuḥ prāptaḥ kumāro na tu nāvabuddhaḥ |dharmo yamāvartaka ityavetya yātastvarāḍābhimukho mumukṣuḥ || 96
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 7 Then they two having understood the true state of things bade that Brāhman at once farewell and wearied though they were went on as if they were unwearied thither whither the prince was gone,tasmāttatastāvupalabhya tattvaṁ taṁ vipramāmaṁttya tadaiva sadyaḥ |khinnāvakhinnāviva rājaputraḥ prasasratustena yataḥ sa yātaḥ || 97

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 9 Leaving his chariot the family priest then went up to the prince with the counsellor as the saint Aurvaśeya 02 went with Vāmadeva wishing to see Rāma when he dwelt in the forest,yānaṁ vihāyopayayau tatastaṁ purohito maṁtradhareṇa sārdham |yathā vanasthaṁ sahavāmadevo rāmaṁ didṛkṣurmuniraurvaśeyaḥ || 99
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 10 They paid him honour as was fitting as Śukra and Aṅgiras honoured Indra in heaven and he in return paid due honour to them as Indra in heaven to Śukra and Aṅgiras,tāvarcayāmāsaturarhatastaṁ divīva śukrāṁgirasau maheṁdram |pratyarcayāmāsa sa cārhatastau divīva śukrāṁgirasau maheṁdraḥ || 910
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 11 Then they having obtained his permission sat down near him who was the banner of the Śākya race and they shone in his proximity like the two stars of the asterism Punarvasū in conjunction with the moon,kṛtābhyanujñāvabhitastatastau niṣīdatuḥ śākyakuladhvajasya |virejatustasya ca saṁnikarṣe punarvasū yogagatāviveṁdoḥ || 911

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 32 Who would not wish to see his dear kindred if but this separation from beloved ones did not exist but since even after it has been once separation will still come again it is for this that I abandon my father however loving,draṣṭuṁ priyaṁ kaḥ svajanaṁ hi necchennāsau yadi syātpriyaviprayogaḥ |yadā tu bhūtvāpi bhavedviyogastato guruṁ snigdhamapi tyajāmi || 932

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 39 That the king should wish to surrender to me his kingdom — this is a noble thought well worthy of a father but it would be as improper for me to accept it as for a sick man through greed to accept unwholesome food,rājyaṁ mumukṣurmayi yacca rājā tadapyudāraṁ sadṛśaṁ pituśca |pratigrahītuṁ mama na kṣamaṁ tu lobhādapathyānnamivāturasya || 939

https//bitly/2wta1x6, And thus kingship is neither pleasure nor dharma so that the kings of old when age came on with it’s unavoidable suffering felt disgust and giving up their kingdoms betook themselves to the forest,itthaṁ ca rājyaṁ na sukhaṁ na dharmaḥ pūrve yathā jātaghṛṇā nareṁdrāḥ |vayaḥprakarṣe parihāryaduḥkhe rājyāni muktvā vanameva jagmuḥ || 942

https//bitly/2wta1x6, For it is praiseworthy for kings to leave their kingdoms and enter the forest in the desire for dharma but it is not fitting to break one’s vow and forsaking the forest to go to one’s home,ślāghyaṁ hi rājyāni vihāya rājñāṁ dharmābhilāṣeṇa vanaṁ praveṣṭum |bhagnapratijñasya na tūpapannaṁ vanaṁ parityajya gṛhaṁ praveṣṭum || 944

https//bitly/2wta1x6, And the man who after escaping with difficulty from a burning house would enter that very house again only he after giving up the state of a householder because he sees its dangers would desire out of delusion to assume it again,yaśca pradīptāccharaṇātkathaṁcinniṣkramya bhūyaḥ praviśettadeva |gārhasthyamutsṛjya sa dṛṣṭadoṣo mohena bhūyo bhilaṣedgrahītum || 947
https//bitly/2wta1x6, As for the tradition that kings obtained final emancipation while remaining in their homes this is not the case How can the dharma of salvation in which quietude predominates be reconciled with the dharma of kings in which severity of action predominates,yā ca śrutirmokṣamavāptavanto nṛpā gṛhasthā iti naitadasti |śamapradhānaḥ kva ca mokṣadharmo daṁḍapradhānaḥ kva ca rājadharmaḥ || 948
https//bitly/2wta1x6, If a king delights in quietude his kingdom collapses if his mind turns to his kingdom his quietude is ruined For quietude and severity are incompatible like the union of water which is cold and fire which is hot,śame ratiścecchithilaṁ ca rājyaṁ rājye matiścecchamaviplavaśca |śamaśca taikṣṇyaṁ ca hi nopapannaṁ śītoṣṇayoraikyamivodakāgnyoḥ || 949
https//bitly/2wta1x6, Either therefore these lords of the earth resolutely cast aside their kingdoms and obtained quietude or stained by kingship they claimed to have attained liberation on the ground that their senses were under control but in fact only reached a state that was not final,tanniścayādvā vasudhādhipāste rājyāni muktvā śamamāptavaṁtaḥ |rājyāṁgitā vā nibhṛtendriyatvādanaiṣṭhike mokṣakṛtābhimānāḥ || 950
https//bitly/2wta1x6, Or let it be conceded they duly attained quietude while holding kingship still I have not gone to the forest with an undecided mind for having cut through the net known as home and kindred I am freed and have no intention of re-entering the net,teṣāṁ ca rājye stu śamo yathāvatprāpto vanaṁ nāhamaniścayena |chittvā hi pāśaṁ gṛhabaṁdhusaṁjñaṁ muktaḥ punarna pravivikṣurasmi || 951

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 46 If there is any activity hereafter we will enjoy ourselves in it as may offer or if there is no activity beyond this life then there is an assured liberation to all the world without any effort,bhūyaḥ pravṛttiryadi kācidasti raṁsyāmahe tatra yathopapattau |atha pravṛttiḥ parato na kācitsiddho prayatnājjagato sya mokṣaḥ || 946 (956)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 47 Some say there is a future life but they do not allow the possibility of liberation as fire is hot by nature and water liquid so they hold that there is a special nature in our power of action 21,astīti kecitparalokamāhurmokṣasya yogaṁ na tu varṇayaṁti |agneryathā hyuṣṇamapāṁ dravatvaṁ tadvatpravṛttau prakṛtiṁ vadaṁti || 947 (957)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 48 Some maintain that all things arise from inherent properties — both good and evil and existence and non-existence and since all this world thus arises spontaneously therefore also all effort of ours is vain,kecitsvabhāvāditi varṇayaṁti śubhāśubhaṁ caiva bhavābhavau ca |svābhāvikaṁ sarvamidaṁ ca yasmādato pi mogho bhavati prayatnaḥ || 948 (958)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 49 Since the action of the senses is fixed and so too the agreeableness or the disagreeableness of outward objects — then for that which is united to old age and pains what effort can avail to alter it Does it not all arise spontaneously,yadiṁdriyāṇāṁ niyataḥ pracāraḥ priyāpriyatvaṁ viṣayeṣu caiva |saṁyujyate yajjarayārttibhiśca kastatra yatno nanu sa svabhāvaḥ || 949 (959)

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 51 That the nature of the embryo in the womb is produced as composed of hands feet belly back and head and that it is also united with the soul — the wise declare that all this comes of itself spontaneously,yatpāṇipādodarapṛṣṭhamūrdhnā nirvartate garbhagatasya bhāvaḥ |yadātmanastasya ca tena yogaḥ svābhāvikaṁ tatkathayaṁti tajjñāḥ || 951 (961)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 52 Who causes the sharpness of the thorn or the various natures of beasts and birds All this has arisen spontaneously there is no acting from desire how then can there be such a thing as will,kaḥ kaṁṭakasya prakaroti taikṣṇyaṁ vicitrabhāvaṁ mṛgapakṣiṇāṁ vā |svabhāvataḥ sarvamidaṁ pravṛttaṁ na kāmakāro sti kutaḥ prayatnaḥ || 952 (962)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 53 Others say that creation comes from Īśvara what need then is there of the effort of the conscious soul 23 That which is the cause of the action of the world is also determined as the cause of its ceasing to act,sargaṁ vadaṁtīśvaratastathānye tatra prayatne puruṣaṣya ko rthaḥ |ya eva heturjagataḥ pravṛttau heturnivṛttau niyataḥ sa eva || 953 (963)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 54 Some say that the coming into being and the destruction of being are alike caused by the soul but they say that coming into being arises without effort while the attainment of liberation is by effort,kecidvadaṁtyātmanimittameva prādurbhavaṁ caiva bhavakṣayaṁ ca |prādurbhavaṁ tu pravadaṁtyayatnādyatnena mokṣādhigamaṁ bruvaṁti || 954 (964)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 55 A man discharges his debt to his ancestors by begetting offspring to the saints by sacred lore to the gods by sacrifices he is born with these three debts upon him — whoever has liberation (from these) he indeed has liberation,naraḥ pit�oṇāmanṛṇaḥ prajābhirvedairṛṣīṇāṁ kratubhiḥ surāṇām |utpadyate sārdhamṛṇaistribhistairyasyāsti mokṣaḥ kila tasya mokṣaḥ || 955 (965)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 56 Thus by this series of rules the wise promise liberation to him who uses effort but however ready for effort with all their energy those who seek liberation will find weariness,ityevametena vidhikrameṇa mokṣaṁ sayatnasya vadaṁti tajjñāḥ |prayatnavaṁto pi hi vikrameṇa mumukṣavaḥ khedamavāpnuvaṁti || 956 (966)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 57 Therefore gentle youth if thou hast a love for liberation follow rightly the prescribed rule thus wilt thou thyself attain to it and the king’s grief will come to an end,tatsaumya mokṣe yadi bhaktirasti nyāyena sevasva vidhiṁ yathoktam |evaṁ bhaviṣyatyupapattirasya saṁtāpanāśaśca narādhipasya || 957 (967)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 58 And as for thy meditations on the evils of life ending in thy return from the forest to thy home — let not the thought of this trouble thee my son — those in old time also have returned from the forests to their houses,yā ca pravṛttā bhavadoṣabuddhistapovanebhyo bhavanaṁ praveṣṭum |tatrāpi ciṁtā tava tāta mā bhūt pūrve pi jagmuḥ svagṛhaṁ vanebhyaḥ || 958 (968)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 59 The king Ambarīṣa 24 though he had dwelt in the forest went back to the city surrounded by his children so too Rāma seeing the earth oppressed by the base came forth from his hermitage and ruled it again,tapovanastho pi vṛtaḥ prajābhirjagāma rājā puramaṁbarīṣaḥ |tathā mahīṁ viprakṛtāmanāryaistapovanādetya rarakṣa rāmaḥ || 959 (969)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 60 So too Drumākṣa the king of the Śālvas came to his city from the forest with his son and Sāṁkṛti Antideva 25 after he had become a Brahmarṣi received his royal dignity from the saint Vaśiṣṭha’,tathaiva śālvādhipatirdrumākṣo vanātsasūnuḥ svapuraṁ praviśya |brahmarṣibhūtaśca munervaśiṣṭhāddadhre śriyaṁ sāṁkṛtiraṁtidevaḥ || 960 (970)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 61 Such men as these illustrious in glory and virtue left the forests and came back to their houses therefore it is no sin to return from a hermitage to one’s home if it be only for the sake of duty’,evaṁvidhā dharmayaśaḥpradīptā vanāni hitvā bhavanānyabhīyuḥ |tasmānna doṣo sti gṛhaṁ praveṣṭuṁ tapovanāddharmanimittameva || 961 (971)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 62 Then having heard the affectionate and loyal words of the minister who was as the eye of the king — firm in his resolve the king’s son made his answer with nothing omitted or displaced 26 neither tedious 27 nor hasty,tato vacastasya niśamya maṁtriṇaḥ priyaṁ hitaṁ caiva nṛpasya cakṣuṣaḥ |anūnamavyastamasaktamadrutaṁ dhṛtau sthito rājasuto bravīdvacaḥ || 962 (972)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 63 This doubt whether anything exists or not is not to be solved for me by another’s words having determined the truth by asceticism or quietism I will myself grasp whatever is ascertained concerning it,ihāsti nāstīti ya eṣa saṁśayaḥ parasya vākyairna mamātra niścayaḥ |avetya tattvaṁ tapasā śamena vā svayaṁ grahīṣyāmi yadatra niścitam || 963 (973)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 64 It is not for me to accept a theory which depends on the unknown and is all controverted and which involves a hundred prepossessions what wise man would go by another’s belief Mankind are like the blind directed in the darkness by the blind,na me kṣamaṁ saṁgaśataṁ hi darśanaṁ grahītumavyaktaparaṁ parāhatam |buddhaḥ parapratyayato hi ko vrajejjano ṁdhakāre ṁdha ivāṁdhadeśitaḥ || 964 (974)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 65 But even though I cannot discern the truth yet still if good and evil are doubted let one’s mind be set on the good even a toil 28 in vain is to be chosen by him whose soul is good while the man of base soul has no joy even in the truth,adṛṣṭatattvasya sato pi kiṁ tu me śubhāśubhe saṁśayite śubhe matiḥ |vṛthāpi khedo pi varaṁ śubhātmanaḥ sukhaṁ na tattve pi vigarhitātmanaḥ || 965 (975)

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 67 And as for what thou saidst to me in regard to my returning to my home by alleging Rāma and others as examples they are no authority — for in determining duty how canst thou quote as authorities those who have broken their vows,gṛhapraveśaṁ prati yacca me bhavānuvāca rāmaprabhṛtīn nidarśanam |na te pramāṇaṁ na hi dharmaniścayeṣvalaṁ pramāṇāya parikṣatavratāḥ || 967 (977)
https//bitly/2wta1x6, 68 Even the sun therefore may fall to the earth even the mountain Himavat may lose its firmness but never would I return to my home as a man of the world with no knowledge of the truth and my senses only alert for external objects,tadevamapyeva ravirmahīṁ patedapi sthiratvaṁ himavān giristyajet |adṛṣṭatattvo viṣayonmukheṁdriyaḥ śrayeya na tveva gṛhān pṛthagjanaḥ || 968 (978)

https//bitly/2wta1x6, 71 Through their love for the prince and their devotion to the king they returned and often stopped looking back 29 they could neither behold him on the road nor yet lose the sight of him — shining in his own splendour and beyond the reach of all others like the sun,tatsnehādatha nṛpateśca bhaktitastau sāpekṣaṁ pratiyayatuśca tasthatuśca |durdharṣaṁ ravimiva dīptamātmabhāsā taṁ draṣṭuṁ na hi pathi śekaturna moktum || 971 (981)

https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 9 Having beheld him with the beautiful circle of hair between his brows 04 and with long eyes with his radiant body and his hands showing a graceful membrane between the fingers — so worthy of ruling the earth and yet wearing a mendicant’s dress — the Goddess of Rājagṛha was herself perturbed,dṛṣṭvā śubhorṇabhruvamāyatākṣaṁ jvalaccharīraṁ śubhajālahastam |taṁ bhikṣuveśaṁ kṣitipālanārhaṁ saṁcukṣubhe rājagṛhasya lakṣmīḥ || 109
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 10 Then Śreṇya 05 the lord of the court of the Magadhas beheld from the outside of his palace the immense concourse of people and asked the reason of it and thus did a man recount it to him,śreṇyo tha bhartā magadhājirasya vāhyādvimānādvipulaṁ janaugham |dadarśa papraccha ca tasya hetuṁ tatastamasmai puruṣaḥ śaśaṁsa || 1010

https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 17 He who was like the Pāṇḍavas in heroism and like a mountain in stature ascended Pāṇḍava that noblest of mountains — a crown-wearer of lion-like gait a lion among men as a maned lion ascends a mountain,sa pāṁḍavaṁ pāṁḍavatulyavīryaḥ śailottamaṁ śailasamānavarṣmā |maulīdharaḥ siṁhagatirnṛsiṁhaścalatsaṭaḥ siṁha ivāruroha || 1017
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 18 There he beheld the Bodhisattva resplendent as he sat on his hams with subdued senses as if the mountain were moving 08 and he himself were a peak thereof — like the moon rising from the top of a cloud,calasya tasyopari śṛṁgabhūtaṁ śāṁteṁdriyaṁ paśyati bodhisattvam |paryaṁkamāsthāya virocamānaṁ śaśāṁkamudyaṁtamivābhrakūṭāt || 1018
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 19 Him distinguished by his beauty of form and perfect tranquillity as the very creation of Religion herself — filled with astonishment and affectionate regard the king of men approached as Indra the self-existent (Brahman),taṁ rūpalakṣmyā ca śamena caiva dharmasya nirmāṇamivopadiṣṭam |savismayaḥ praśrayavān nareṁdraḥ svayaṁbhuvaṁ śakra ivopatasthe || 1019

https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 21 Then the king sat down on the clean surface of the rock dark blue like an elephant’s ear and being seated 09 with the other’s assent he thus spoke desiring to know his state of mind,tataḥ śucau vāraṇakarṇanīle śilātale sau niṣasāda rājā |nṛpopaviśyānumataśca tasya bhāvaṁ vijijñāsuridaṁ babhāṣe || 1021

https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 23 When I consider thy widespread race beginning with the sun thy fresh youth and thy conspicuous beauty — whence comes this resolve of thine so out of all harmony with the rest set wholly on a mendicant’s life not on a kingdom,ādityapūrvaṁ vipulaṁ kulaṁ te navaṁ vayo dīptamidaṁ vapuśca |kasmādiyaṁ te matirakrameṇa bhaikṣāka evābhiratā na rājye || 1023
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 24 Thy limbs are worthy of red sandal-wood 10 perfumes — they do not deserve the rough contact of red cloth this hand is fit to protect subjects it deserves not to hold food given by another,gātraṁ hi te lohitacaṁdanārhaṁ kāṣāyasaṁśleṣamanarhametat |hastaḥ prajāpālanayogya eṣa bhoktuṁ na cārhaḥ paradattamannam || 1024
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 25 If therefore gentle youth through thy love for thy father thou desirest not thy paternal kingdom in thy generosity — then at any rate thy choice must not be excused — accepting forthwith one half of my kingdom,tatsaumya rājyaṁ yadi paitṛkaṁ tvaṁ snehātpiturnecchasi vikrameṇa |na ca kṣamaṁ marṣayituṁ matiste bhuktvārdhamasmadviṣayasya śīghram || 1025
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 26 If thou actest thus there will be no violence shown to thine own people and by the mere lapse of time imperial power at last flies for refuge to the tranquil mind therefore be pleased to do me a kindness — the prosperity of the good becomes very powerful when aided by the good 11,evaṁ hi na syātsvajanāvamardaḥ kālakrameṇāpi śamaśrayā śrīḥ |tasmātkuruṣva praṇayaṁ mayi tvaṁ sadbhiḥ sahīyā hi satāṁ samṛddhiḥ || 1026

https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 28 Choose thou therefore one of these ends pursue according to rule religious merit wealth and pleasure for these love and the rest in reverse order are the three objects in life when men die they pass into dissolution as far as regards this world,tadbuddhimatrānyatarāṁ vṛṇīṣva dharmārthakāmān vidhivadbhajasva |vyatyasya rāgādi ha hi trivargaṁ pretyeha vibhraṁśamavāpnuvaṁti || 1028
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 29 That which is pleasure when it has overpowered wealth and merit is wealth when it has conquered merit and pleasure so too it is merit when pleasure and wealth fall into abeyance but all would have to be alike abandoned if thy desired end 12 were obtained,yo hyarthadharmau paripīḍya kāmaḥ syāddharmakāmye paribhūya cārthaḥ |kāmārthayoścoparameṇa dharmastyājyaḥ sa kṛtsno yadi kāṁkṣitārthaḥ || 1029
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 30 Do thou therefore by pursuing the three objects of life cause this beauty of thine to bear its fruit they say that when the attainment of religion wealth and pleasure is complete in all its parts then the end of man is complete,tasmāttrivargasya niṣevaṇena tvaṁ rūpametatsaphalaṁ kuruṣva |dharmārthakāmādhigamaṁ hyanūnaṁ nṛṇāmanūnaṁ puruṣārthamāhuḥ || 1030

https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 32 I speak this to you out of affection — not through love of dominion or through astonishment beholding this mendicant-dress of thine I am filled with compassion and I shed tears,snehena khalvetadahaṁ bravīmi naiśvaryarāgeṇa na vismayena |imaṁ hi dṛṣṭvā tava bhikṣuveśaṁ jātānukaṁpo smyapi cāgatāśruḥ || 1032
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 33 O thou who desirest the mendicant’s stage of life enjoy pleasures now in due time O thou lover of religion thou shalt practise religion — ere old age comes on and overcomes this thy beauty well worthy of thy illustrious race,tadbhuṁkṣva bhikṣāśramakāma kāmānkāle si kartā priyadharma dharmam |yāvatsvavaṁśapratirūparūpaṁ na te jarābhyetyabhibhūya bhūyaḥ || 1033
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 34 The old man can obtain merit by religion old age is helpless for the enjoyment of pleasures therefore they say that pleasures belong to the young man wealth to the middle-aged and religion to the old,śaknoti jīrṇaḥ khalu dharmamāptuṁ kāmopabhogeṣvagatirjarāyāḥ |ataśca yūnaḥ kathayaṁti kāmānmadhyasya vittaṁ sthavirasya dharmam || 1034
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 35 Youth in this present world is the enemy of religion and wealth — since pleasures however we guard them are hard to hold therefore wherever pleasures are to be found there they seize them,dharmasya cārthasya ca jīvaloke pratyarthibhūtāni hi yauvanāni |saṁrakṣyamāṇānyapi durgrahāṇi kāmā yatastena yathā haraṁti || 1035
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 36 Old age is prone to reflection’ 13 it is grave and intent on remaining quiet it attains unimpassionedness with but little effort unavoidably and for very shame,vayāṁsi jīrṇāni vimarśayaṁti dhīrāṇyavasthānaparāyaṇāni |alpena yatnena śamātmakāni bhavaṁtyagatyeva ca lajjayā ca || 1036
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 37 Therefore having passed through the deceptive period of youth fickle intent on external objects heedless impatient not looking at the distance — they take breath like men who have escaped safe through a forest,ataśca lolaṁ viṣayapradhānaṁ pramattamakṣāṁtamadīrghadarśi |bahucchalaṁ yauvanamabhyatītya nistīrya kāṁtāramivāśvasaṁti || 1037
https//bitly/2xgEaQC, 38 Let therefore this fickle time of youth first pass by reckless and giddy — our early years are the mark for pleasure they cannot be kept from the power of the senses,tasmādadhīraṁ capalapramādi navaṁ vayastāvadidaṁ vyapaitu |kāmasya pūrvaṁ hi vayaḥ śaravyaṁ na śakyate rakṣitumiṁdriyebhyaḥ || 1038

https//bitly/2iisXd4, 2 This is not to be called a strange thing for thee born as thou art in the great family whose ensign is the lion 01 — that by thee of pure conduct O lover of thy friends this line of conduct should be adopted towards him who stands as one of thy friends,nāścaryametadbhavato bhidhātuṁ jātasya haryaṁkakule viśāle |yanmitrapakṣe tava mitrakāma syādvṛttireṣā pariśuddhavṛtteḥ || 112
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 3 Amongst the bad a friendship worthy of their family ceases to continue (and fades) like prosperity among the faint-hearted it is only the good who keep increasing the old friendship of their ancestors by a new succession of friendly acts,asatsu maitrī svakulānurūpā na tiṣṭhati śrīriva viklaveṣu |pūrvaiḥ kṛtāṁ prītiparaṁparābhistāmeva saṁtastu vivardhayaṁti || 113

https//bitly/2iisXd4, 28 What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which are like the fruit that grows on the top of a tree — which those who would leap up to reach fall down upon a mountain or into a forest waters or the ocean,girau vane cāpsu ca sāgare ca yadbhraṁśamarchaṁtyabhilaṁghamānāḥ |teṣu drumaprāgraphalopameṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt || 1128
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 29 What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which are like snatching up a hot coal — men never attain happiness however they pursue them increase them or guard them,tīrthaiḥ prayatnairvividhairavāptāḥ kṣaṇena ye nāśamiha prayāṁti | 1129svapnopabhogapratimeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt |
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 30 What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which are like the enjoyments in a dream — which are gained by their recipients after manifold pilgrimages and labours and then perish in a moment,yānarcayitvāpi na yāṁti śarma vivardhayitvā paripālayitvā |aṁgārakarṣapratimeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt || 1130
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 31 What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which are like a spear 13 sword or club — for the sake of which the Kurus the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas the Maithilas and the Daṇḍakas suffered destruction,vināśamīyuḥ kuravo yadarthaṁ vṛṣṇyaṁdhakā maithiladaṁḍakāśca |śūlāsikāṣṭhapratimeṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt || 1131
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 32 What man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which dissolve friendships and for the sake of which the two Asuras Sunda and Upasunda perished victims engaged in mutual enmity,suṁdopasuṁdāvasurau yadarthamanyonyavairaprasṛtau vinaṣṭau |sauhārdaviśleṣakareṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt || 1132
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 33 None however their intellect is blinded with pleasure give themselves up as in compassion to ravenous beasts 14 so what man of self-control could find satisfaction in those pleasures which are disastrous and constant enemies,kāmāṁdhasaṁjñāḥ kṛpayā va ke ca kravyātsu nātmānamihotsṛjaṁti |sapatnabhūteṣvaśiveṣu teṣu kāmeṣu kasyātmavato ratiḥ syāt || 1133
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 34 He whose intellect is blinded with pleasure does pitiable things he incurs calamities such as death bonds and the like the wretch who is the miserable slave of hope for the sake of pleasure well deserves the pain of death even in the world of the living,kāmāṁdhasaṁjñaḥ kṛpaṇaṁ karoti prāpnoti duḥkhaṁ vadhabaṁdhanādi |kāmārthamāśākṛpaṇastapasvī mṛtyuśramaṁ cārhati jīvaloke || 1134
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 35 Deer are lured to their destruction by songs 15 insects for the sake of the brightness fly into the fire the fish greedy for the flesh swallows the iron hook — therefore worldly objects produce misery as their end,gītairhriyaṁte hi mṛgā vadhāya rūpārthamagnau śalabhāḥ pataṁti |matsyo giratyāyasamāmiṣārthī tasmādanarthaṁ viṣayāḥ phalaṁti || 1135
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 36 As for the common opinion pleasures are enjoyments none of them when examined are worthy of being enjoyed fine garments and the rest are only the accessories of things — they are to be regarded as merely the remedies for pain,kāmāstu bhogā iti yanmataṁ syādbhogyā na kecitparigaṇyamānāḥ |vastrādayo dravyaguṇā hi loke duḥkhapratīkāra iti pradhāryāḥ || 1136
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 37 Water is desired for allaying thirst food in the same way for removing hunger a house for keeping off the wind the heat of the sun and the rain and dress for keeping off the cold and to cover one’s nakedness,iṣṭaṁ hi tarṣapraśamāya toyaṁ kṣunnāśahetoraśanaṁ tathaiva |vātātapāṁbvāvaraṇāya veśma kaupīnaśītāvaraṇāya vāsaḥ || 1137
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 38 So too a bed is for removing drowsiness a carriage for remedying the fatigue of a journey a seat for alleviating the pain of standing so bathing as a means for washing health and strength,nidrāvighātāya tathaiva śayyā yānaṁ tathādhvaśramanāśanāya |tathāsanaṁ sthānavinodanāya snānaṁ mṛjārogyabalāśrayāya || 1138
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 39 External objects therefore are to human beings means for remedying pain not in themselves sources of enjoyment what wise man would allow that he enjoys those delights which are only used as remedial,duḥkhapratīkāranimittabhūtāstasmātprajānāṁ viṣayā na bhogyāḥ |aśnāmi bhogāniti ko bhyupeyātprājñaḥ pratīkāravidhau pravṛttān || 1139
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 40 He who when burned with the heat of bilious fever maintains that cold appliances are an enjoyment when he is only engaged in alleviating pain — he indeed might give the name of enjoyment to pleasures,yaḥ pittadāhena vidahyamānaḥ śītakriyāṁ bhoga iti vyavasyet |duḥkhapratīkāravidhau pravṛttaḥ kāmeṣu kuryātsa hi bhogasaṁjñām || 1140
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 41 Since variableness is found in all pleasures I cannot apply to them the name of enjoyment the very conditions which mark pleasure bring also in its turn pain,kāmeṣvanaikāṁtikatā ca yasmādato pi me teṣu na bhogasaṁjñā |ya eva bhāvā hi sukhaṁ diśaṁti ta eva duḥkhaṁ punarāvahaṁti || 1141
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 42 Heavy garments and fragrant aloe-wood are pleasant in the cold but an annoyance in the heat 16 and the moonbeams and sandal-wood are pleasant in the heat but a pain in the cold,gurūṇi vāsāṁsyagurūṇi caiva sukhāya śīte hyasukhāya gharme |caṁdrāṁśavaścaṁdanameva coṣṇe sukhāya duḥkhāya bhavaṁti śīte || 1142
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 43 Since the well-known opposite pairs 17 such as gain and loss and the rest are inseparably connected with everything in this world — therefore no man is invariably happy on the earth nor invariably wretched,dvaṁdvāni sarvasya yataḥ prasaktānyalābhalābhaprabhṛtīni loke |ato pi naikāṁtasukho sti kaścinnaikāṁtaduḥkhaḥ puruṣaḥ prṭhivyām || 1143
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 44 When I see how the nature of pleasure and pain are mixed I consider royalty and slavery as the same a king does not always smile nor is a slave always in pain,dṛṣṭvā ca miśrāṁ sukhaduḥkatāṁ me rājyaṁ ca dāsyaṁ ca mataṁ samānam |nityaṁ hasatyeva hi naiva rājā na cāpi saṁtapyata eva dāsaḥ || 1144
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 45 Since to be a king involves a wider range of command therefore the pains of a king are great for a king is like a peg 18 — he endures trouble for the sake of the world,ājñā nṛpatve bhyadhiketi yasmātmahāṁti duḥkhānyata eva rājñaḥ |āsaṁgakāṣṭhapratimo hi rājā lokasya hetoḥ parikhedameti || 1145
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 46 A king is unfortunate if he places his trust in his royalty which is apt to desert and loves crooked turns 19 and on the other hand if he does not trust in it then what can be the happiness of a timid king,rājye nṛpastyāgini vaṁkamitre viśvāsamāgacchati cedvipannaḥ |athāpi viśraṁbhamupaiti neha kiṁ nāma saukhyaṁ cakitasya rājñaḥ || 1146
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 47 And since after even conquering the whole earth one city only can serve as a dwelling-place and even there only one house can be inhabited is not royalty mere labour for others,yadā ca jitvāpi mahīṁ samagrāṁ vāsāya dṛṣṭaṁ puramekameva |tatrāpi caikaṁ bhavanaṁ niṣevyaṁ śramaḥ parārthe nanu rājabhāvaḥ || 1147
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 48 And even in royal clothing one pair of garments is all he needs and just enough food to keep off hunger so only one bed and only one seat all a king’s other distinctions are only for pride,rājyo pi vāse yugamekameva kṣutsaṁnirodhāya tathānnamātrā |śayyā tathaikāsanamekameva śeṣā viśeṣā nṛpatermadāya || 1148
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 49 And if all these fruits are desired for the sake of satisfaction I can be satisfied without a kingdom and if a man is once satisfied in this world are not all distinctions indistinguishable,tuṣṭyarthametacca phalaṁ yadīṣṭamṛte pi rājyānmama tuṣṭirasti |tuṣṭau ca satyāṁ puruṣasya loke sarve viśeṣā nanu nirviśeṣāḥ || 1149
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 50 He then who has attained the auspicious road to happiness is not to be deceived in regard to pleasures remembering thy professed friendship tell me again and again do they keep their promise,tannāsti kāmān prati saṁpratāryaḥ kṣeme śivaṁ mārgamanuprapannaḥ |smṛtvā suhṛttvaṁ tu punaḥ punarmāṁ brūhi pratijñāṁ khalu pālayaṁti || 1150
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 51 I have not repaired to the forest through anger nor because my diadem has been dashed down by an enemy’s arrows nor have I set my desires on loftier objects 20 that I thus refuse thy proposal,na hyasmyamarṣeṇa vanapraviṣṭo na śatrubāṇairavadhūtamauliḥ |kṛtaspṛho nāpi phalādhikebhyo gṛhṇāmi naitadvacanaṁ yataste || 1151
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 52 Only he who having once let go a malignant incensed serpent or a blazing hay-torch all on fire would strive again to seize it would ever seek pleasures again after having once abandoned them,yo daṁdaśūkaṁ kupitaṁ bhujaṁgaṁ muktvā vyavasyeddhi punargrahītum |dāhātmikāṁ vā jvalitāṁ tṛṇaulkāṁ saṁtyajya kāmānsa punarbhajeta || 1152
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 53 Only he who though seeing would envy the blind though free the bound though wealthy the destitute though sound in his reason the maniac — only he I say would envy one who is devoted to worldly objects,aṁdhāya yaśca spṛhayedanaṁdho baddhāya mukto vidhanāya vāḍhyaḥ |unmattacittāya ca kalyacittaḥ spṛhāṁ sa kuryādviṣayātmakāya || 1153
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 54 He who lives on alms my good friend is not to be pitied having gained his end and being set on escaping the fear of old age and death he has here the best happiness perfect calm and hereafter all pains are for him abolished,bhikṣopabhogī vara nānukaṁpyaḥ kṛtī jarāmṛtyubhayaṁ titīrṣuḥ |ihottamaṁ śāṁtisukhaṁ ca yasya paratra duḥkhāni ca saṁvṛtāni || 1154
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 55 But he is to be pitied who is overpowered by thirst though set in the midst of great wealth — who attains not the happiness of calm here while pain has to be experienced hereafter,lakṣmyāṁ mahatyāmapi vartamānastṛṣṇābhibhūtastvanukaṁpitavyaḥ |prāpnoti yaḥ śāṁtisukhaṁ na ceha paratra duḥkhaṁ pratigṛhyate ca || 1155
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 56 Thus to speak to me is well worthy of thy character thy mode of life and thy family and to carry out my resolve is also befitting my character my mode of life and my family,evaṁ tu vaktuṁ bhavato nurūpaṁ sattvasya vṛttasya kulasya caiva |mamāpi voḍhuṁ sadṛśaṁ pratijñāṁ sattvasya vṛttasya kulasya caiva || 1156
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 57 I have been wounded by the enjoyment of the world and I have come out longing to obtain peace I would not accept an empire free from all ill even in the third heaven how much less amongst men,ahaṁ hi saṁsārarasena viddho viniḥsṛtaḥ śāṁtamavāptukāmaḥ |neccheyamāptuṁ tridive pi rājyaṁ nirāmayaṁ kiṁ vata mānuṣeṣu || 1157
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 58 But as for what thou saidst to me O king that the universal pursuit of the three objects is the supreme end of man — and 21 thou saidst that what I regard as the desirable is misery — thy three objects are perishable and also unsatisfying,trivargasevāṁ nṛpa yattu kṛtsnataḥ paro manuṣyārtha iti tvamāttha mām |anartha ityāttha mamārthadarśanaṁ kṣayī trivargo hi na cāpi tarpakaḥ || 1158
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 59 But that world in which there is no old age nor fear no birth nor death nor anxieties 22 that alone I consider the highest end of man where there is no ever-renewed action,pade tu yasminna jarā na bhīrutā na janma naivoparamo na vādhayaḥ |tameva manye puruṣārthamuttamaṁ na vidyate yatra punaḥ punaḥ kriyā || 1159
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 60 And as for what thou saidst wait till old age comes for youth is ever subject to change — this want of decision is itself uncertain for age too can be irresolute and youth can be firm,yadapyavocaḥ paripālyatāṁ jarā navaṁ vayo gacchati vikriyāmiti |aniścayo yaṁ capalaṁ hi dṛśyate jarāpyadhīrā dhṛtimacca yauvanam || 1160
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 61 But since Fate 23 is so well skilled in its art as to draw the world in all its various ages into its power — how shall the wise man who desires tranquillity wait for old age when he knows not when the time of death will be,svakarmadakṣaśca yadā tu ko jagadvayaḥsu sarveṣu ca saṁvikarṣati |vināśakāle kathamavyavasthite jarā pratīkṣyā viduṣā śamepsunā || 1161
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 62 When death stands ready like a hunter with old age as his weapon and diseases scattered about as his arrows smiting down living creatures who fly like deer to the forest of destiny what desire can there be in any one for length of life,jarāyudho vyādhivikīrṇasāyako yadāṁtako vyādha ivāśritaḥ sthitaḥ |prajāmṛgān bhāgyavanāśritāṁstudan vayaḥprakarṣaṁ prati ko manorathaḥ || 1162
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 63 It well befits the youthful son or the old man or the child so to act with all promptitude that they may choose the action of the religious man whose soul is all mercy — nay better still his inactivity,suto yuvā vā sthaviro thavā śiśustathā tvarāvāniha kartumarhati |yathā bhaveddharmavataḥ kṛpātmanaḥ pravṛttiriṣṭā vinivṛttireva vā || 1163
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 64 And as for what thou saidst be diligent in sacrifices for religion such as are worthy of thy race and bring a glorious fruit — honour to such sacrifices I desire not that fruit which is sought by causing pain to others 24,yadāttha vā dīptaphalāṁ kulocitāṁ kuruṣva dharmāya makhakriyāmiti |namo makhebhyo na hi kāmaye sukhaṁ parasya duḥkhakriyayāpadiśyate || 1164
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 65 To kill a helpless victim through a wish for future reward — it would be an unseemly action for a merciful-hearted good man even if the reward of the sacrifice were eternal but what if after all it is subject to decay,paraṁ hi haṁtuṁ vivaśaṁ phalepsayā na yuktarūpaṁ karuṇātmanaḥ sataḥ |kratoḥ phalaṁ yadyapi śāśvataṁ bhavet tathāpi kṛtvā kimupakṣayātmakam || 1165
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 66 And even if true religion did not consist in quite another rule of conduct by self-restraint moral practice and a total absence of passion — still it would not be seemly to follow the rule of sacrifice where the highest reward is described as attained only by slaughter,bhavecca dharmo yadi nāparo vidhirvratena śīlena manaḥśamena vā |tathāpi naivārhati sevituṁ kratuṁ viśasya yasmin paramucyate phalam || 1166
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 67 Even that happiness which comes to a man while he stays in this world through the injury of another is hateful to the wise compassionate heart how much more if it be something beyond our sight in another life,ihāpi tāvatpuruṣasya tiṣṭhataḥ pravartate yatparahiṁsayā sukham |tadapyaniṣṭaṁ saghṛṇasya dhīmato bhavāṁtare kiṁ vata yanna dṛśyate || 1167
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 68 I am not to be lured into a course of action for future reward — my mind does not delight O king in future births these actions are uncertain and wavering in their direction like plants beaten by the rain from a cloud,na ca pratāryo smi phalapravṛttaye bhaveṣu rājan ramate na me manaḥ |latā ivāṁbhodharavṛṣṭitāḍitāḥ pravṛttayaḥ sarvagatā hi caṁcalā || 1168
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 69 I have come here with a wish to see next the seer Arāḍa who proclaims liberation I start this very day — happiness be to thee O king forgive my words which may seem harsh through their absolute freedom from passion 25,ihāgataścāhamito didṛkṣayā munerarāḍasya vimokṣavādinaḥ |prayāmi cādyaiva nṛpāstu te śivaṁ vacaḥ kṣamethāḥ śamatattvaniṣṭhuram || 1169
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 70 26Now therefore do thou guard (the world) like Indra in heaven guard it continually like the sun by thy excellencies guard its best happiness here guard the earth guard life by the noble 27 guard the sons of the good guard thy royal powers O king and guard thine own religion,atheṁdravaddivyava śaśvadarkavadguṇairava śreya ihāva gāmava |avāyurāryairava satsutān ava śriyaśca rājannava dharmamātmanaḥ || 1170
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 71 As in the midst of a sudden catastrophe arising from the flame of (fire) the enemy of cold a bird to deliver its body betakes itself to the enemy of fire (water) — so do thou when occasion calls betake thyself to deliver thy mind to those who will destroy the enemies of thy home’ 28,himāriketūdbhavasaṁplavāṁtare yathā dvijo yāti vimokṣayaṁstanum |himāriśatruṁ kṣayaśatrughātinastathāṁtare yāhi vimocayanmanaḥ || 1171
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 72 The king himself folding his hands with a sudden longing come upon him replied Thou art obtaining thy desire without hindrance when thou hast at last accomplished all that thou hast to do thou shalt show hereafter thy favour towards me’,nṛpo bravītsāṁjalirāgataspṛho yatheṣṭamāpnoti bhavānavighnataḥ |avāpya kāle kṛtakṛtyatāmimāṁ mamāpi kāryo bhavatā tvanugrahaḥ || 1172
https//bitly/2iisXd4, 73 Having given his firm promise to the monarch he proceeded to the Vaiśvantara hermitage and after watching him with astonishment as he wandered on in his course the king and 29 his courtiers returned to the mountain (of Rājagiri),sthiraṁ pratijñāya tatheti pārthive tataḥ sa vaiśvaṁtaramāśramaṁ yayau |parivrajaṁtaṁ samudīkṣya vismito nṛpo pi ca prāpurimaṁ giriṁ vrajan || 1173

https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 26 “I say I know I go I am firmly fixed it is thus that egoism shows itself here O thou who art free from all egoism,bravīmyahamahaṁ vedmi gacchāmyahamahaṁ sthitaḥ |itīhaivamahaṁkārastvanahaṁkāra vartate || 1226
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 27 That state of mind is called confusion O thou who art all unconfused which views under one nature massed like a lump of clay objects that thus become confused in their nature,yastu bhāvena saṁdigdhānekībhāvena paśyati |mṛtpiṁḍavadasaṁdeha saṁdehaḥ sa ihocyate || 1227

https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 29 That state of mind is called indiscrimination O thou who art discriminating which thinks there is no difference between the illuminated and the unwise and between the different evolvents,aviśeṣaṁ viśeṣajña pratibuddhāprabuddhayoḥ |prakṛtīnāṁ ca yo veda so viśeṣa iti smṛtaḥ || 1229
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 30 Uttering namas and vaṣaṭ sprinkling water upon sacrifices &c with or without the recital of Vedic hymns and such like rites — these are declared by the wise to be false means O thou who art well skilled in true means,namaskāravaṣaṭkārau prokṣaṇābhyukṣaṇādayaḥ |anupāya iti prājñairupāyajña praveditaḥ || 1230
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 31 That is called inordinate attachment by which the fool is entangled in external objects through his mind speech actions and thoughts O thou who hast shaken thyself free from all attachments,sajjate yena durmedhā manovākkarmabuddhibhiḥ |viṣayeṣvanabhiṣvaṁga so bhiṣvaṁga iti smṛtaḥ || 1231
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 32 The misery which a man imagines by the ideas This is mine I am connected with this is to be recognised as gravitation — by this a man is borne downwards into new births,mamedamahamasyeti yadduḥkhamabhimanyate |vijñeyo bhyavapātaḥ sa saṁsāre yena pātyate || 1232
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 33 Thus Ignorance O ye wise being fivefold in its character energises towards torpor delusion the great delusion and the two kinds of darkness 06,ityavidyā hi vidvāṁsaḥ paṁcaparvā samīhate |tamo mohaṁ mahāmohaṁ tāmisradvayameva ca || 1233
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 34 Know that among these indolence is torpor death and birth are delusion and be it clearly understood O undeluded one that desire is the great delusion,tatrālasyaṁ tamo viddhi mohaṁ mṛtyuṁ ca janma ca |mahāmohastvasaṁmoha kāma ityavagamyatām || 1234
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 35 Since by it even the higher beings are deluded therefore O hero is this called the great delusion,yasmādatra ca bhūtāni pramuhyaṁti mahāṁtyapi |tasmādeṣa mahābāho mahāmoha iti smṛtaḥ || 1235
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 36 They define anger O thou angerless one as darkness and despondency O undesponding they pronounce to be the blind darkness,tāmisramiti cākrodha krodhamevādhikurvate |viṣādaṁ cāṁdhatāmisramaviṣāda pracakṣate || 1236
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 37 The child entangled in this fivefold ignorance is effused in his different births in a world abounding with misery,anayāvidyayā bālaḥ saṁyuktaḥ paṁcaparvayā |saṁsāre duḥkhabhūyiṣṭhe janmasvabhiniṣicyate || 1237
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 38 He wanders about in the world of embodied existence thinking that I am the seer and the hearer and the thinker — the effect and the cause,draṣṭā śrotā ca maṁtā ca kāryaṁ karaṇameva ca |ahamityevamāgamya saṁsāre parivartate || 1238
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 39 Through these causes 07 O wise prince the stream of torpor is set in motion be pleased to consider that in the absence of the cause there is the absence of the effect,ityebhirhetubhirdhīman tamaḥsrotaḥ pravartate |hetvabhāve phalābhāva iti vijñātumarhasi || 1239
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 40 Let the wise man who has right views know these four things O thou who desirest liberation — the illuminated and the unilluminated the manifested and the unmanifested,tatra samyagmatirvidyānmokṣakāma catuṣṭayam |pratibuddhāprabuddhau ca vyaktamavyaktameva ca || 1240
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 41 The soul having once learned to distinguish these four properly having abandoned all (ideas of) straightness or quickness 08 attains to the immortal sphere,yathāvadetadvijñāya kṣetrajño hi catuṣṭayam |ārjavaṁ javatāṁ hitvā prāpnoti padamakṣaram || 1241
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 42 For this reason the Brāhmans in the world discoursing on the supreme Brahman practise here a rigorous course of sacred study and let other Brāhmans live with them to follow it also’,ityarthaṁ brāhmaṇā loke paramabrahmavādinaḥ |brahmacaryaṁ caraṁtīha brāhmaṇān vāsayaṁti ca || 1242
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 43 The prince having heard this discourse from the seer asked concerning the means and the final state,iti vākyamidaṁ śrutvā munestasya nṛpātmajaḥ |abhyupāyaṁ ca papraccha padameva ca naiṣṭhikam || 1243
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 44 Wilt thou please to explain to me how how far and where this life of sacred study is to be led and the limit of this course of life’ 09,brahmacaryamidaṁ caryaṁ yathā yāvacca yatra ca |dharmasyāsya ca paryaṁtaṁ bhavān vyākhyātumarhati || 1244
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 45 Then Arāḍa according to his doctrine declared to him in another way that course of life clearly and succinctly,ityarāḍo yathāśāstraṁ vispaṣṭārthaṁ samāsataḥ |tamevānyena kalpena dharmamasmai vyabhāṣata || 1245
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 46 The devotee in the beginning having left his house and assumed the signs of the mendicant goes on following a rule of conduct which extends to the whole life,ayamādau gṛhānmuktvā bhaikṣākaṁ liṁgamāśritaḥ |samudācāravistīrṇaṁ śīlamādāya vartate || 1246
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 47 Cultivating absolute content with any alms from any person he carries out his lonely life indifferent to all feelings meditating on the holy books and satisfied in himself,saṁtoṣaṁ paramāsthāya yena tena yatastataḥ |viviktaṁ sevate vāsaṁ nirdvaṁdvaḥ śāstravitkṛtī || 1247
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 48 Then having seen how fear arises from passion and the highest happiness from the absence of passion he strives by restraining all the senses to attain to tranquillity of mind,tato rāgādbhayaṁ dṛṣṭvā vairāgyācca paraṁ śivam |nigṛhṇanniṁdriyagrāmaṁ yatate manasaḥ śrame || 1248
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 49 Then he reaches the first stage of contemplation which is separated from desires evil intentions and the like and arises from discrimination and which involves reasoning 10,atho viviktaṁ kāmebhyo vyāpādādibhya eva ca |vivekajamavāpnoti pūrvadhyānaṁ vitarkavat || 1249
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 50 And having obtained this ecstatic contemplation and reasoning on various objects the childish mind is carried away by the possession of the new unknown ecstasy,tacca dhyānaṁ sukhaṁ prāpya tattadeva vitarkayan |apūrvasukhalābhena hriyate bāliśo janaḥ || 1250
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 51 With a tranquillity of this kind which disdains desire or dislike he reaches the world of Brahman deceived by the delight,śamenaivaṁvidhenāyaṁ kāmadveṣavigarhiṇā |brahmalokamavāpnoti paritoṣeṇa vaṁcitaḥ || 1251
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 52 But the wise man knowing that these reasonings bewilder the mind reaches a (second) stage of contemplation separate from this which has its own pleasure and ecstasy,jñātvā vidvān vitarkāṁstu manaḥsaṁkṣobhakārakān |tadviyuktamavāpnoti dhyānaṁ prītisukhānvitam || 1252
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 53 And he who carried away by this pleasure sees no further distinction obtains a dwelling full of light even amongst the Ābhāsura deities,hriyamāṇastayā prītyā yo viśeṣaṁ na paśyati |sthānaṁ bhāsvaramāpnoti deveṣvābhāsureṣvapi || 1253
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 54 But he who separates his mind from this pleasure and ecstasy reaches the third stage of contemplation ecstatic but without pleasure,yastu prītisukhāttasmādvivecayati mānasam |tṛtīyaṁ labhate dhyānaṁ sukhaṁ prītivivarjitam || 1254
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 55 Upon this stage some teachers make their stand thinking that it is indeed liberation since pleasure and pain have been left behind and there is no exercise of the intellect,tatra kecidvyavasyaṁti mokṣa ityapi māninaḥ |sukhaduḥkhaparityāgādavyāpārācca cetasaḥ || 1255 (57)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 56 But he who immersed in this ecstasy strives not for a further distinction obtains an ecstasy in common with the Śubhakṛtsna deities,yastu tasminsukhe magno na viśeṣāya yatnavān |śubhakṛtsnaiḥ sa sāmānyaṁ sukhaṁ prāpnoti daivataiḥ || 1256 (55)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 57 But he who having attained such a bliss desires it not but despises it obtains the fourth stage of contemplation which is separate from all pleasure or pain,tādṛśaṁ sukhamāsādya yo na rajyannupekṣate |caturthaṁ dhyānamāpnoti sukhaduḥkhavivarjitam || 1257 (56)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 58 The fruit of this contemplation which is on an equality with the Vṛhatphala deities those who investigate the great wisdom call the Vṛhatphala 11,asya dhyānasya tu phalaṁ samaṁ devairvṛhatphalaiḥ |kathayaṁti vṛhatphalaṁ vṛhatprajñāparīkṣakāḥ || 1258
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 59 But rising beyond this contemplation having seen the imperfections of all embodied souls the wise man climbs to a yet higher wisdom in order to abolish all body,samādhervyutthitastasmāddṛṣṭvā doṣāṁścharīriṇām |jñānamārohati prājñaḥ śarīravinivṛttaye || 1259
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 60 Then having abandoned this contemplation being resolved to find a further distinction he becomes as disgusted with form itself as he who knows the real is with pleasures,tatastaddhyānamutsṛjya viśeṣe kṛtaniścayaḥ |kāmebhya iva satprājño rūpādapi virajyate || 1260
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 61 First he makes use of all the apertures of his body and next he exerts his will to experience a feeling of void space even in the solid parts 12,śarīre khāni yānyasya tānyādau parikalpayan |ghaneṣvapi tato dravyeṣvākāśamadhimucyate || 1261
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 62 But another wise man having contracted his soul which is by nature extended everywhere like the ether 13 — as he gazes ever further on detects a yet higher distinction,ākāśasamamātmānaṁ saṁkṣipya tvaparo budhaḥ |tadaivānaṁtataḥ paśyan viśeṣamadhigacchati || 1262
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 63 Another one of those who are profoundly versed in the supreme Self having abolished himself by himself sees that nothing exists and is called a Nihilist 14,adhyātmakuśaleṣvanyo nivartyātmānamātmanā |kiṁcinnāstīti saṁpaśyannākiṁcanya iti smṛtaḥ || 1263
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 64 Then like the Muñja-reed’s stalk 15 from its sheath or the bird from its cage the soul escaped from the body is declared to be liberated,tato muṁjādiṣīkeva śakuniḥ paṁjarādiva |kṣetrajño niḥsṛto dehānmukta ityabhidhīyate || 1264
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 65 This is that supreme Brahman constant eternal and without distinctive signs which the wise who know reality declare to be liberation,etattatparamaṁ brahma nirliṁgaṁ dhruvamakṣaram |yanmokṣa iti tattvajñāḥ kathayaṁti manīṣiṇaḥ || 1265
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 66 Thus have I shown to thee the means and liberation if thou hast understood and approved it then act accordingly,ityupāyaśca mokṣaśca mayā saṁdarśitastava |yadi jñātaṁ yadi ruci yathāvatpratipadyatām || 1266
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 67 Jaigīṣavya 16 and Janaka and the aged Parāsara by following this path were liberated and so were others who sought liberation’,jaigīṣavyo tha janako vṛddhaścaiva parāśaraḥ |imaṁ paṁthānamāsādya muktā hyanye ca mokṣiṇaḥ || 1267
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 68 The prince having not accepted his words but having pondered them filled with the force of his former arguments thus made answer,iti tasya sa tadvākyaṁ gṛhītvā na vicārya ca |pūrvahetubalaprāptaḥ pratyuttaramuvāca saḥ || 1268
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 69 I have heard this thy doctrine subtil and pre-eminently auspicious but I hold that it cannot be final because it does not teach us how to abandon this soul itself in the various bodies,śrutaṁ jñānamidaṁ sūkṣmaṁ parataḥ parataḥ śivam |kṣetreṣvasyāparityāgādavaimyetadanaiṣṭhikam || 1269
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 70 For I consider that the embodied soul though freed from the evolutes and the evolvents is still subject to the condition of birth and has the condition of a seed 17,vikāraprakṛtibhyo hi kṣetrajñaṁ muktamapyaham |manye prasavadharmāṇaṁ vījadharmāṇameva ca || 1270
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 71 Even though the pure soul is declared to be liberated yet as long as the soul remains there can be no absolute abandonment of it,viśuddho yadyapi hyātmā nirmukta iti kalpyate | 18a 18b (ab = 1271ab)atyaṁtastatparityāgaḥ satyātmani na vidyate || 1271 (cd = 1273cd)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 72 If we abandon successively all this triad yet distinction is still perceived as long as the soul itself continues there this triad continues in a subtil form,hitvā hitvā trayamidaṁ viśeṣastūpalabhyate |ātmanastu sthitiryatra tatra sūkṣmamidaṁ trayam || 12 72 (1274)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 73 It is held (by some) that this is liberation because the imperfections are so attenuated and the thinking power is inactive and the term of existence is so prolonged,sūkṣmatvāccaiva doṣāṇāmavyāpārācca cetasaḥ |dīrghatvādāyuṣaścaiva mokṣastu parikalpyate || 1273 (1275)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 74 But as for this supposed abandonment of the principle of egoism — as long as the soul continues there is no real abandonment of egoism,ahaṁkāraparityāgo yaścaiṣa parikalpyate |satyātmani parityāgo nāhaṁkārasya vidyate || 1274 (1276)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 75 The soul does not become free from qualities as long as it is not released from number and the rest therefore as long as there is no freedom from qualities there is no liberation declared for it,saṁkhyādibhiramuktaśca nirguṇo na bhavatyayam |tasmādasati nairguṇye nāsya mokṣo bhidhīyate || 1275 (1277)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 76 There is no real separation of the qualities and their subject for fire cannot be conceived apart from its form and heat,guṇino hi guṇānāṁ ca vyatireko na vidyate |rūpoṣṇābhyāṁ virahito na hyagnirupalabhyate || 1276 (1278)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 77 Before the body there will be nothing embodied so before the qualities there will be no subject how if it was originally free could the soul ever become bound 19,prāgdehānna bhaveddehī prāgguṇebhyastathā guṇī |kasmādādau vimuktaḥ sañśarīrī badhyate punaḥ || 1277 (1279)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 78 The body-knower (the soul) which is unembodied must be either knowing or unknowing if it is knowing there must be some object to be known and if there is this object it is not liberated,kṣetrajño viśarīraśca jño vā syādajña eva vā |yadi jño jñeyamasyāsti jñeye sati na mucyate || 1278 (1280)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 79 Or if the soul is declared to be unknowing then of what use to you is this imagined soul Even without such a soul the existence of the absence of knowledge is notorious as for instance in a log of wood or a wall,athājña iti siddho vaḥ kalpitena kimātmanā |vināpi hyātmanājñānaṁ prasiddhaṁ kāṣṭhakuḍyavat || 1279 (1281)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 80 And since each successive abandonment is held to be still accompanied by qualities I maintain that the absolute attainment of our end can only be found in the abandonment of everything’,parataḥ paratastyāgo yasmāttu guṇavān smṛtaḥ |tasmātsarvaparityāgānmanye kṛtsnāṁ kṛtārthatām || 1280 (1282)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 81 Thus did he remain unsatisfied after he had heard the doctrine of Arāḍa then having decided it to be incomplete he turned away,iti dharmamarāḍasya viditvā na tutoṣa saḥ |akṛtsnamiti vijñāya tataḥ pratijagāma ha || 1281 (1283)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 82 Seeking to know the true distinction he went to the hermitage of Udraka 20 but he gained no clear understanding from his treatment of the soul,viśeṣamatha śuśrūṣurudrakasyāśramaṁ yayau |ātmagrāhācca tasyāpi jagṛhe na sa darśanam || 1282 (1284)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 83 For the sage Udraka having learned the inherent imperfections of the name and the thing named took refuge in a theory beyond Nihilism which maintained a name and a non-name,saṁjñāsaṁjñitvayordoṣaṁ jñātvā hi munirudrakaḥ |ākiṁcinyātparaṁ lebhe saṁjñāsaṁjñātmikāṁ gatim || 1283 (1285)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 84 And since even a name and a non-name were substrata however subtil he went even further still and found his restlessness set at rest in the idea that there is no named and no un-named,yasmāccālaṁbane sūkṣme saṁjñāsaṁjñe tataḥ param |nāsaṁjñī naiva saṁjñīti tasmāttatra gataspṛhaḥ || 1284 (1286)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 85 And because the intellect rested there not proceeding any further — it became very subtil and there was no such thing as un-named nor as named,yataśca buddhistatraiva sthitānyatrāpracāriṇī |sūkṣmāpādi tatastatra nāsaṁjñitvaṁ na saṁjñitā || 1285 (1287)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 86 But because even when it has reached this goal it yet returns again to the world therefore the Bodhisattva seeking something beyond left Udraka,yasmācca tamapi prāpya punarāvartate jagat |bodhisattvaḥ paraṁ prepsustasmādudrakamatyajat || 1286 (1288)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 87 Having quitted his hermitage fully resolved in his purpose and seeking final bliss he next visited the hermitage called a city of the royal sage Gaya,tato hitvāśramaṁ tasya śreyo rthī kṛtaniścayaḥ |bheje gayasya rājarṣernagarīsaṁjñamāśramam || 1287 (1289)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 88 Then on the pure bank of the Nairañjanā the saint whose every effort was pure fixed his dwelling bent as he was on a lonely habitation,atha nairaṁjanātīre śucau śuciparākramaḥ |cakāra vāsamekāṁtavihārābhivratī muniḥ || 1288 (12 90)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, (Then he saw five mendicants who had come there before him they had taken vows on themselves and practised austerities vaunting themselves of control of the five senses),21<,> tatpūrvaṁ paṁceṁdriyavaśoddhatān |tapaḥ <xx> vratino bhikṣūn paṁca niraikṣata || (1291)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 89 Five mendicants desiring liberation came up to him when they beheld him there just as the objects of the senses come up to a percipient who has gained wealth and health by his previous merit,paṁcopatasthurdṛṣṭvātra bhikṣavastaṁ mumukṣavaḥ |puṇyārjitadhanārogyamiṁdriyārthā iveśvaram || 1289 (1292)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 90 Being honoured by these disciples who were dwelling in that family as they bowed reverently with their bodies bent low in humility as the mind is honoured by the restless senses,saṁpūjyamānastaiḥ prahvairvinayānatamūrtibhiḥ |tadvaṁśasthāyibhiḥ śiṣyairlolairmana iveṁdriyaiḥ || 1290 (1293)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 91 And thinking this may be the means of abolishing birth and death’ he at once commenced a series of difficult austerities by fasting,mṛtyujanmāṁtakaraṇe syādupāyo yamityatha |duṣkarāṇi samārebhe tapāṁsyanaśanena saḥ || 1291 (1294)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 92 For six years vainly trying to attain merit 22 he practised self-mortification performing many rules of abstinence hard for a man to carry out,upavāsavidhīn nekān kurvan naradurācarān |varṣāṇi ṣaṭkarmaprepsurakarotkārśyamātmanaḥ || 1292 (1295)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 93 At the hours for eating he longing to cross the world whose farther shore is so difficult to reach broke his vow with single jujube fruits sesame seeds and rice,annakāleṣu caikaikaiḥ sakolatilataṁḍulaiḥ |apārapārasaṁsārapāraṁ prepsurapārayat || 1293 (1296)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 94 But the emaciation which was produced in his body by that asceticism became positive fatness through the splendour which invested him,dehādapacayastena tapasā tasya yaḥ kṛtaḥ |sa evopacayo bhūyastejasāsya kṛto bhavat || 1294 (1297)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 95 Though thin yet with his glory and his beauty unimpaired he caused gladness to other eyes as the autumnal moon in the beginning of her bright fortnight gladdens the lotuses,kṛśo pyakṛśakīrtiśrīrhlādaṁ cakre nyacakṣuṣam |kumudānāmiva śaracchuklapakṣādicaṁdramāḥ || 1295 (1298)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 96 Having only skin and bone remaining with his fat flesh and blood entirely wasted yet though diminished he still shone with undiminished grandeur like the ocean,tvagasthiśeṣo niḥśeṣairmedaḥpiśitaśoṇitaiḥ |kṣīṇo pyakṣīṇagāṁbhīryaḥ samudra iva sa vyabhāt || 1296 (1299)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 97 Then the seer having his body evidently emaciated to no purpose in a cruel self-mortification — dreading continued existence thus reflected in his longing to become a Buddha,atha kaṣṭatapaḥspaṣṭavyarthakliṣṭatanurmuniḥ |bhavabhīrurimāṁ cakre buddhiṁ buddhatvakāṁkṣayā || 1297 (12100)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 98 This is not the way to passionlessness nor to perfect knowledge nor to liberation that was certainly the true way which I found at the root of the Jambu 23 tree,nāyaṁ dharmo virāgāya na bodhāya na muktaye |jaṁbumūle mayā prāpto yastadā sa vidhirdhruvaḥ || 1298 (12101)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 99 But that cannot be attained by one who has lost his strength’ — so resuming his care for his body he next pondered thus how best to increase his bodily vigour,na cāsau durbalenāptuṁ śakyamityāgatādaraḥ |śarīrabalavṛddhyarthamidaṁ bhūyo nvaciṁtayat || 1299 (12102)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 100 Wearied with hunger thirst and fatigue with his mind no longer self-possessed through fatigue how should one who is not absolutely calm reach the end which is to be attained by his mind,kṣutpipāsāśramaklāṁtaḥ śramādasvasthamānasaḥ |prāpnuyānmanasāvāpyaṁ phalaṁ kathamanirvṛtaḥ || 12100 (12103)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 101 True calm is properly obtained by the constant satisfaction of the senses the mind’s self-possession is only obtained by the senses being perfectly satisfied,nirvṛtiḥ prāpyate samyaksatateṁdriyatarpaṇāt |saṁtarpiteṁdriyatayā manaḥsvāsthyamavāpyate || 12101 (12104)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 102 True meditation is produced in him whose mind is self-possessed and at rest — to him whose thoughts are engaged in meditation the exercise of perfect contemplation begins at once,svasthaprasannamanasaḥ samādhirupapadyate |samādhiyuktacittasya dhyānayogaḥ pravartate || 12102 (12105)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 103 By contemplation are obtained those conditions 24 through which is eventually gained that supreme calm undecaying immortal state which is so hard to be reached’,dhyānapravartanāddharmāḥ prāpyaṁte yairavāpyate |durlabhaṁ śāṁtamajaraṁ paraṁ tadamṛtaṁ padam || 12103 (12106)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 104 Having thus resolved this means is based upon eating food’ the wise seer of unbounded wisdom having made up his mind to accept the continuance of life,tasmādāhāramūlo yamupāya itiniścayaḥ |asūrikaraṇe dhīraḥ kṛtvāmitamatirmatim || 12104 (12107)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 105 And having bathed thin as he was slowly came up the bank of the Nairañjanā supported as by a hand by the trees on the shore which bent down the ends of their branches in adoration,snāto nairaṁjanātīrāduttatāra śanaiḥ kṛśaḥ |bhaktyāvanataśākhāgrairdattahastastaṭadrumaiḥ || 12105 (12108)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 106 Now at that time Nandabalā the daughter of the leader of the herdsmen impelled by the gods with a sudden joy risen in her heart had just come near,atha gopādhipasutā daivatairabhicoditā |udbhūtahṛdayānaṁdā tatra naṁdabalāgamat || 12106 (12109)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 107 Her arm gay with a white shell and wearing a dark blue woollen cloth like the river Yamunā with its dark blue water and its wreath of foam,sitaśaṁkhojjvalabhujā nīlakaṁbalavāsinī |sapheṇamālānīlāṁburyamuneva saridvarā || 12107 (12110)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 108 She having her joy increased by her faith with her lotus-like eyes opened wide bowed down before him and persuaded him to take some milk,sā śraddhāvardhitaprītirvikasallocanotpalā |śirasā praṇipatyainaṁ grāhayāmāsa pāyasam || 12108 (12111)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 109 By partaking that food having made her obtain the full reward of her birth he himself became capable of gaining the highest knowledge all his six senses being now satisfied,kṛtvā tadupabhogena prāptajanmaphalāṁ sa tām |bodhiprāptau samartho bhūtsaṁtarpitaṣaḍiṁdriyaḥ || 12109 (12112)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 110 The seer having his body now fully robust together with his glorious fame one beauty and one majesty being equally spread in both shone like the ocean and the moon 25,paryāptāpyānamūrtaśca sārdhaṁ suyaśasā muniḥ |kāṁtidhairyaikabhāraikaḥ śaśāṁkārṇavavalbabhau || 12110 (12113)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 111 Thinking that he had returned to the world the five mendicants left him as the five elements leave the wise soul when it is liberated,āvṛtta iti vijñāya taṁ jahuḥ paṁcabhikṣavaḥ |manīṣiṇamivātmānaṁ nirmuktaṁ paṁcadhātavaḥ || 12111 (12114)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 112 Accompanied only by his own resolve having fixed his mind on the attainment of perfect knowledge he went to the root of an Aśvattha tree 26 where the surface of the ground was covered with young grass,vyavasāyadvitīyo tha śādvalāstīrṇabhūtalam |so śvatthamūlaṁ prayayau bodhāya kṛtaniścayaḥ || 12112 (12115)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 113 Then Kāla 27 the best of serpents whose majesty was like the lord of elephants having been awakened by the unparalleled sound of his feet uttered this praise of the great sage being sure that he was on the point of attaining perfect knowledge,tatastadānīṁ gajarājavikramaḥ padasvanenānupamena bodhitaḥ |mahāmunerāgatabodhiniścayo jagāda kālo bhujagottamaḥ stutim || 12113 (12116)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 114 Inasmuch as the earth pressed down by thy feet O sage resounds repeatedly and inasmuch as thy splendour shines forth like the sun thou shalt assuredly to-day enjoy the desired fruit,yathā mune tvaccaraṇāvapīḍitā muhurmuhurniṣṭanatīva medinī |yathā ca te rājati sūryavatprabhā dhruvaṁ tvamiṣṭaṁ phalamadya bhokṣyase || 12114 (12117)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 115 Inasmuch as lines of birds fluttering in the sky offer thee reverential salutation O lotus-eyed one and inasmuch as gentle breezes blow in the sky thou shalt certainly to-day become the Buddha’,yathā bhramaṁtyo divi vāyapaṁktayaḥ pradakṣiṇaṁ tvāṁ kamalākṣa kurvate |yathā ca saumyā divi vāṁti vāyavastvamadya buddho niyataṁ bhaviṣyasi || 12115 (12118)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 116 Being thus praised by the best of serpents and having taken some pure grass from a grasscutter he having made his resolution sat down to obtain perfect knowledge at the foot of the great holy tree,tato bhujaṁgapravareṇa saṁstutastṛṇānyupādāya śucīni lāvakāt |kṛtapratijño niṣasāda bodhaye mahātarormūlamupāśritaḥ śuceḥ || 12116 (12119)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 117 Then he sat down on his hams in a posture immovably firm and with his limbs gathered into a mass like a sleeping serpent’s hood exclaiming I will not rise from this position on the earth until 28 I have obtained my utmost aim’,tataḥ sa paryaṁkamakaṁpyamuttamaṁ babaṁdha suptoragabhogapiṁḍitam |bhinadmi tāvadbhuvi naitadāsanaṁ na yāmi tāvatkṛtakṛtyatāmiti || 12117 (12120)
https//bitly/2vAtD1Z, 118 Then the dwellers in heaven burst into unequalled joy the herds of beasts and the birds uttered no cry the trees moved by the wind made no sound when the holy one took his seat firm in his resolve,tato yayurmudamatulāṁ divaukaso vavāsire na mṛgaganā na pakṣiṇaḥ |na sasvanurvanataravo nilāhatāḥ kṛtāsane bhagavati niścalātmani || 12118 (12121)
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 1 When the great sage sprung from a line of royal sages sat down there with his soul fully resolved to obtain the highest knowledge the whole world rejoiced but Māra the enemy of the good law was afraid,tasminśca bodhāya kṛtapratijñe rājarṣivaṁśaprabhave mahārṣau |tatropaviṣṭe prajaharṣa lokastatrāsa saddharmaripustu māraḥ || 131
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 2 He whom they call in the world Kāmadeva the owner of the various weapons the flower-arrowed the lord of the course of desire — it is he whom they also style Māra the enemy of liberation,yaṁ kāmadevaṁ pravadaṁti loke citrāyudhaṁ puṣpaśaraṁ tathaiva |kāmapracārādhipatiṁ tameva mokṣadviṣaṁ māramudāharaṁti || 132
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 3 His three sons Confusion Gaiety and Pride and his three daughters Lust Delight and Thirst 01 asked of him the reason of his despondency and he thus made answer unto them,tasyātmajā vibhramaharṣadarpāstisro ratiprītitṛṣaśca kanyāḥ |papracchurenaṁ manaso vikāraṁ sa tāṁśca tāścaiva vaco babhāṣe || 133
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 4 This sage wearing the armour of resolution and having drawn the arrow of wisdom with the barb of truth sits yonder intending to conquer my realms — hence is this despondency of my mind,asau munirniścayavarma bibhrat sattvāyudhaṁ buddhiśaraṁ vikṛṣya |jigīṣurāste viṣayānmadīyān tasmādayaṁ me manaso viṣādaḥ || 134
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 5 If he succeeds in overcoming me and proclaims to the world the path of final bliss all this my realm will to-day become empty as did that of the disembodied lord when he violated the rules of his station 02,yadi hyasau māmabhibhūya yāti lokāya cākhyātyapavargamārgam |śūnyastato yaṁ viṣayo mamādya vṛttāccyutasyeva videhabhartuḥ || 135
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 6 While therefore he stands within my reach and while his spiritual eyesight is not yet attained I will assail him to break his vow as the swollen might of a river assails a dam’,tadyāvadevaiṣa na labdhacakṣurmadgocare tiṣṭhati yāvadeva |yāsyāmi tāvadvratamasya bhettuṁ setuṁ nadīvega ivābhivṛddhaḥ || 136
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 7 Then having seized his flower-made bow and his five infatuating arrows he drew near to the root of the Aśvattha tree with his children he the great disturber of the minds of living beings,tato dhanuḥ puṣpamayaṁ gṛhītvā śarāṁstathā mohakarāṁśca paṁca |so śvatthamūlaṁ sasuto bhyagacchadasvāsthyakārī manasaḥ prajānām || 137
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 8 Having fixed his left hand on the end of the barb and playing with the arrow Māra thus addressed the calm seer as he sat on his seat preparing to cross to the further side of the ocean of existence,atha praśāṁtaṁ munimāsanasthaṁ pāraṁ titīrṣuṁ bhavasāgarasya |viṣajya savyaṁ karamāyudhāgre krīḍañśareṇedamuvāca māraḥ || 138
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 9 Up up O thou Kṣatriya afraid of death follow thine own duty and abandon this law of liberation and having conquered the lower worlds by thy arrows  proceed to gain the higher worlds of Indra,uttiṣṭha bhoḥ kṣatriya mṛtyubhīta varasva dharmaṁ tyaja mokṣadharmam |vāṇaiśca  03 vinīya lokān lokān parān prāpnuhi vāsavasya || 139
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 10 That is a glorious path to travel which has been followed by former leaders of men this mendicant life is ill-suited for one born in the noble family of a royal sage to follow,paṁthā hi niryātumayaṁ yaśasyo yo vāhitaḥ pūrvatamairnareṁdraiḥ |jātasya rājarṣikule viśāle bhaikṣākamaślāghyamidaṁ prapattum || 1310
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 11 But if thou wilt not rise strong in thy purpose — then be firm if thou wilt and quit not thy resolve — this arrow is uplifted by me — it is the very one which was shot against Sūryaka 04 the enemy of the fish,athādya nottiṣṭhasi niścitātmā bhava sthiro mā vimucaḥ pratijñām |mayodyato hyeṣa śaraḥ sa eva yaḥ sūryake mīnaripau vimuktaḥ || 1311
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 12 So too I think when somewhat probed by this weapon even the son of Iḍā 05 the grandson of the moon became mad and Sāntanu 06 also lost his self-control — how much more then one of feebler powers now that the age has grown degenerate,pṛṣṭaḥ sa cānena kathaṁcidaiḍaḥ somasya naptāpyabhavadvicittaḥ |sa cābhavacchāṁtanurasvataṁtraḥ kṣīṇe yuge kiṁ vata durbalo nyaḥ || 1312
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 13 Therefore quickly rise up and come to thyself - for this arrow is ready darting out its tongue which I do not launch even against the cakravāka birds tenderly attached as they are and well deserving the name of lovers’,tatkṣipramuttiṣṭha labhasva saṁjñāṁ vāṇo hyayaṁ tiṣṭhati lelihānaḥ |priyābhidheyeṣu ratipriyeṣu yaṁ cakravākeṣvapi notsṛjāmi || 1313
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 14 But when even though thus addressed the Śākya saint unheeding did not change his posture then Māra discharged his arrow at him setting in front of him his daughters and his sons 07,ityevamukto pi yadā nirāstho naivāsanaṁ śākyamunirbibheda |śaraṁ tato smai visasarja māraḥ kanyāśca kṛtvā purataḥ sutāṁśca || 1314
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 15 But even when that arrow was shot he gave no heed and swerved not from his firmness and Māra beholding him thus sank down and slowly thus spoke full of thought,tasmiṁstu vāṇe pi sa vipramukte cakāra nāsthāṁ na dhṛteścacāla |dṛṣṭvā tathainaṁ viṣasāda māraściṁtāparītaśca śanairjagāda || 1315
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 16 He does not even notice that arrow by which the god Śambhu was pierced with love for the daughter of the mountain 08 and shaken in his vow can he be destitute of all feeling is not this that very arrow,śaileṁdraputrīṁ prati yena viddho devo pi śaṁbhuścalito babhūva |na ciṁtayatyeṣa tameva vāṇaṁ kiṁ syādacitto na śaraḥ sa eṣaḥ || 1316
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 17 He is not worthy of my flower-shaft nor my arrow gladdener nor the sending of my daughter Rati (to tempt him) he deserves the alarms and rebukes and blows from all the gathered hosts of the demons’,tasmādayaṁ nārhati puṣpavāṇaṁ na harṣaṇaṁ nāpi raterniyogam |arhatyayaṁ bhūtagaṇairaśeṣaiḥ saṁtrāsanātarjanatāḍanāni || 1317
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 18 Then Māra called to mind his own army wishing to work the overthrow of the Śākya saint and his followers swarmed round wearing different forms and carrying arrows trees darts clubs and swords in their hands,sasmāra māraśca tataḥ svasainyaṁ vidhvaṁsanaṁ śākyamuneścikīrṣan |nānāśrayāścānucarāḥ parīyuḥ śaradrumaprāsagadāsihastāḥ || 1318

https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 20 Blended with goats with knees swollen like pots armed with tusks and with claws carrying headless trunks in their hands and assuming many forms with half-mutilated faces and with monstrous mouths,ajāsu saktā ghaṭajānavaśca daṁṣṭrāyudhāścaiva nakhāyudhāśca |kabaṁdhahastā bahumūrtayaśca bhagnārdhavaktrāśca mahāmukhāśca || 1320
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 21 Copper-red covered with red spots bearing clubs in their hands with yellow or smoke-coloured hair with wreaths dangling down with long pendulous ears like elephants clothed in leather or wearing no clothes at all,tāmrāruṇā lohitaviṁducitrāḥ khaṭvāṁgahastā haridhūmrakeśāḥ |laṁbasrajo vāraṇalaṁbakarṇāścarmāṁbarāścaiva niraṁbarāśca || 1321

https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 23 Some were as tall as palm-trees carrying spears — others were of the size of children with projecting teeth others birds with the faces of rams others with men’s bodies and cats’ faces,tālapramāṇāśca gṛhītaśūlā daṁṣṭrākarālāśca śiśupramāṇāḥ |urabhravaktrāśca vihaṁgamāśca mārjāravaktrāśca manuṣyakāyāḥ || 1323
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 24 With dishevelled hair or with topknots or half-bald with rope-garments or with head-dress all in confusion — with triumphant faces or frowning faces — wasting the strength or fascinating the mind,prakīrṇakeśāḥ śikhino rdhamuṁḍā rajjvaṁbarā vyākulaveṣṭanāśca |prahṛṣṭavaktrā bhṛkuṭīmukhāśca tejoharāścaiva manoharāśca || 1324
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 25 Some as they went leaped about wildly others danced upon one another some sported about in the sky others went along on the tops of the trees,kecidvrajaṁto bhṛśamāvavalguranyo nyamāpupluvire tathānye |cikrīḍurākāśagatāśca kecitkecicca cerustarumastakeṣu || 1325
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 26 One danced shaking a trident another made a crash dragging a club another bounded for joy like a bull another blazed out flames from every hair,nanarta kaścidbhramayaṁstriśūlaṁ kaściddha pusphūrja gadāṁ vikarṣan |harṣeṇa kaścidvṛṣavannanarta kaścitprajajvāla tanūruhebhyaḥ || 1326
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 27 Such were the troops of demons who encircled the root of the Bodhi tree on every side eager to seize it and to destroy it awaiting the command of their lord,evaṁvidhā bhūtagaṇāḥ samaṁtāttadbodhimūlaṁ parivārya tasthuḥ |jighṛkṣavaścaiva jighāṁsavaśca bharturniyogaṁ paripālayaṁtaḥ || 1327
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 28 Beholding in the first half of the night that battle of Māra and the bull of the Śākya race the heavens did not shine and the earth shook and the (ten) regions of space flashed flame and roared,taṁ prekṣya mārasya ca pūrvarātre śākyarṣabhasyaiva ca yuddhakālam |na dyauścakāśe pṛthivī cakaṁpe prajajvaluścaiva diśaḥ saśabdāḥ || 1328
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 29 A wind of intense violence blew in all directions 09 the stars did not shine the moon gave no light and a deeper darkness of night spread around and all the oceans were agitated,viṣvagvavau vāyurudīrṇavegastārā na rejurna babhau śaśāṁkaḥ |tamaśca bhūyo vitatāra rātreḥ sarve ca saṁcukṣubhire samudrāḥ || 1329
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 30 The mountain deities 10 and the Nāgas who honoured the Law indignant at the attack on the saint rolling their eyes in anger against Māra heaved deep sighs and opened their mouths wide,mahībhṛto dharmaparāśca nāgā mahāmunervighnamamṛṣyamāṇāḥ |māraṁ prati krodhavivṛttanetrā niḥśaśvasuścaiva jajṛṁbhire ca || 1330
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 31 But the god-sages the Śuddhādhivāsas 11 being as it were absorbed in the perfect accomplishment of the good Law felt only a pity for Māra in their minds and through their absolute passionlessness were unruffled by anger,śuddhādhivāsā vibudharṣayastu saddharmasiddhyarthamiva pravṛttāḥ |māre nukaṁpāṁ manasā pracakrurvirāgabhāvāttu na roṣamīyuḥ || 1331
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 32 When they saw the foot of the Bodhi tree crowded with that host of Māra intent on doing harm — the sky was filled with the cry raised by all the virtuous beings who desired the world’s liberation,tadbodhimūlaṁ samavekṣya kīrṇaṁ hiṁsātmanā mārabalena tena |dharmātmabhirlokavimokṣakāmairbabhūva hāhākṛtamaṁtarīkṣam || 1332
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 33 But the great sage 12 having beheld that army of Māra thus engaged in an attack on the knower of the Law 13 remained untroubled and suffered no perturbation like a lion seated in the midst of oxen,upaplutaṁ dharmavidastu tasya dṛṣṭvā sthitaṁ mārabalaṁ mahārṣiḥ |na cukṣubhe nāpi yayau vikāraṁ madhye gavāṁ siṁha ivopaviṣṭaḥ || 1333
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 34 Then Māra commanded his excited army of demons to terrify him and forthwith that host resolved to break down his determination with their various powers,mārastato bhūtacamūmudīrṇāmājñāpayāmāsa bhayāya tasya |svaiḥ svaiḥ prabhāvairatha sāsya senā taddhairyabhedāya matiṁ cakāra || 1334
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 35 Some with many tongues hanging out and shaking with sharp-pointed savage teeth and eyes like the disk of the sun with wide-yawning mouths and upright ears like spikes — they stood round trying to frighten him,keciccalannaikavilaṁbijihvāstīkṣṇogradaṁṣṭrā harimaṁḍalākṣāḥ |vidāritāsyāḥ sthiraśaṁkukarṇāḥ saṁtrāsayaṁtaḥ kila nāma tasthuḥ || 1335
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 36 Before these monsters standing there so dreadful in form and disposition the great sage remained unalarmed and untroubled sporting with them as if they had been only rude children 14,tebhyaḥ sthitebhyaḥ sa tathāvidhebhyaḥ rūpeṇa bhāvena ca dāruṇebhyaḥ |na vivyathe nodvivije mahārṣiḥ krīḍan subālebhya ivoddhatebhyaḥ || 1336
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 37 Then one of them with his eyes rolling wildly lifted up a club against him but his arm with the club was instantly paralysed as was Indra’s of old with its thunderbolt 15,kaścittato raudravivṛttadṛṣṭistasmai gadāmudyamayāṁcakāra |tastaṁbha bāhuḥ sagadastato sya puraṁdarasyeva purā savajraḥ || 1337
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 38 Some having lifted up stones and trees found themselves unable to throw them against the sage down they fell with their trees and their stones like the roots of the Vindhya shattered by the thunderbolt,kecitsamudyamya śilāstarūṁśca viṣehire naiva munau vimoktum |petuḥ savṛkṣāḥ saśilāstathaiva vajrāvabhagnā iva viṁdhyapādāḥ || 1338
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 39 Others leaping up into the sky flung rocks trees and axes these remained in the sky and did not fall down like the many-coloured rays of the evening clouds,kaiścitsamutpatya nabho vimuktāḥ śilāśca vṛkṣāśca paraśvadhāśca |tasthurnabhasyeva na cāvapetuḥ saṁdhyābhrapādā iva naikavarṇāḥ || 1339
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 40 Another hurled upon him a mass of blazing straw as big as a mountain-peak which as soon as it was thrown while it hung poised in the sky was shattered into a hundred fragments by the sage’s power,cikṣepa tasyopari dīptamanyaḥ kaḍaṁgaraṁ parvataśṛṁgamātram |yanmuktamātraṁ gaganasthameva tasyānubhāvācchatadhā babhūva || 1340
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 41 One rising up like the sun in full splendour rained down from the sky a great shower of live embers as at the end of an aeon blazing Meru showers down the pulverised scoriae of the golden valleys,kaścijjvalannarka ivoditaḥ khādaṁgāravarṣaṁ mahadutsasarja |cūrnāni cāmīkarakaṁdarāṇāṁ kalpātyaye meruriva pradīptaḥ || 1341
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 42 But that shower of embers full of sparks when scattered at the foot of the Bodhi tree became a shower of red lotus-petals through the operation of the great saint’s boundless charity,tadbodhimūle pravikīryamāṇamaṁgāravarṣaṁ tu savisphuliṁgam |maitrīvihārādṛṣisattamasya babhūva raktotpalapatravarṣaḥ || 1342
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 43 But with all these various scorching assaults on his body and his mind and all these missiles showered down upon him the Śākya saint did not in the least degree move from his posture clasping firmly his resolution as a kinsman,śarīracittavyasanātapaistairevaṁvidhaistaiśca nipātyamānaiḥ |naivāsanācchākyamuniścacāla svaṁ niścayaṁ baṁdhumivopaguhya || 1343
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 44 Then others spat out serpents from their mouths as from old decayed trunks of trees but as if held fast by a charm near him they neither breathed nor discharged venom nor moved,athāpare nirjagalurmukhebhyaḥ sarpānvijīrṇebhya iva drumebhyaḥ |te maṁtrabaddhā iva tatsamīpe na śaśvasurnotsasṛjurna celuḥ || 1344
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 45 Others having become great clouds emitting lightning and uttering the fierce roar of thunderbolts poured a shower of stones upon that tree — but it turned to a pleasant shower of flowers,bhūtvāpare vāridharā vṛhaṁtaḥ savidyutaḥ sāśanicaṁḍaghoṣāḥ |tasmin drume tatyajuraśmavarṣaṁ tatpuṣpavarṣaṁ ruciraṁ babhūva || 1345
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 46 Another set an arrow in his bow — there it gleamed but it did not issue forth like the anger which falls slack 16 in the soul of an ill-tempered impotent man,cāpe tha vāṇo nihito pareṇa jajvāla tatraiva na niṣpapāta |anīśvarasyātmani dhūryamāṇo durmarṣaṇasyeva narasya manyuḥ || 1346
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 47 But five arrows shot by another stood motionless and fell not through the saint’s ruling guidance — like the five senses of him who is well experienced in the course of worldly objects and is afraid of embodied existence,paṁceṣavo nyena tu vipramuktāstasthurnayatyeva munau na petuḥ |saṁsārabhīrorviṣayapravṛttau paṁceṁdriyāṇīva parīkṣakasya || 1347
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 48 Another full of anger rushed towards the great saint having seized a club with a desire to smite him but he fell powerless without finding an opportunity like mankind in the presence of faults which cause failure 17,jighāṁsayānyaḥ prasasāra ruṣṭo gadāṁ gṛhītvābhimukho mahārṣeḥ |so prāptakālo vivaśaḥ papāta doṣeṣvivānarthakareṣu lokaḥ || 1348
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 49 But a woman named Meghakālī bearing a skull in her hand in order to infatuate the mind of the sage flitted about unsettled and stayed not in one spot like the mind of the fickle student over the sacred texts,strī meghakālī tu kapālahastā kartuṁ mahārṣeḥ kila mohacittam |babhrāma tatrāniyataṁ na tasthau calātmano buddhirivāgameṣu || 1349
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 50 Another fixing a kindling eye wished to burn him with the fire of his glance like a poisonous serpent but he saw the sage and lo he was not there like the votary of pleasure when true happiness is pointed out to him 18,kaścitpradīptaṁ praṇidhāya cakṣurnetrāgnināśīviṣavaddidhakṣuḥ |tatraiva nāsīttamṛṣiṁ dadarśa kāmātmakaḥ śreya ivopadiṣṭam || 1350
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 51 Another lifting up a heavy rock wearied himself to no purpose having his efforts baffled like one who wishes to obtain by bodily fatigue that condition of supreme happiness which is only to be reached by meditation and knowledge,gurvīṁ śilāmudyamayaṁstathānyaḥ śaśrāma moghaṁ vihataprayatnaḥ |niḥśreyasaṁ jñānasamādhigamyaṁ kāyaklamairdharmamivāptukāmaḥ || 1351
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 52 Others wearing the forms of hyenas and lions uttered loudly fierce howls which caused all beings round to quail with terror as thinking that the heavens were smitten with a thunderbolt and were bursting,tarakṣusiṁhākṛtayastathānye praṇeduruccairmahataḥ praṇādān |sattvāni yaiḥ saṁcukucuḥ samaṁtādvajrāhatā dyauḥ phalatīti matvā || 1352
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 53 Deer and elephants uttering cries of pain ran about or lay down — in that night as if it were day screaming birds flew around disturbed in all directions,mṛgā gajāścārttaravān sṛjaṁto vidudruvuścaiva nililyire ca |rātrau ca tasyāmahanīva digbhyaḥ khagā ruvaṁtaḥ paripeturārttāḥ || 1353
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 54 But amidst all these various sounds which they made although all living creatures were shaken the saint trembled not nor quailed like Garuḍa at the noise of crows,teṣāṁ praṇādaistu tathāvidhaistaiḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣvapi kaṁpiteṣu |munirna tatrāsa na saṁcukoca ravairgarutmāniva vāyasānām || 1354
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 55 The less the saint feared the frightful hosts of that multitude the more did Māra the enemy of the righteous continue his attacks in grief and anger,bhayāvahebhyaḥ pariṣadgaṇebhyo yathā yathā naiva munirbibhāya |tathā tathā dharmabhṛtāṁ sapatnaḥ śokācca roṣācca sasāra māraḥ || 1355
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 56 Then some being of invisible shape but of pre-eminent glory standing in the heavens — beholding Māra thus malevolent against the seer — addressed him in a loud voice unruffled by enmity,bhūtaṁ tataḥ kiṁcidadṛśyarūpaṁ viśiṣṭarūpaṁ gaganasthameva |dṛṣṭvārṣaye drugdhamavairaruṣṭaṁ māraṁ babhāṣe mahatā svareṇa || 1356
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 57 Take not on thyself O Māra this vain fatigue — throw aside thy malevolence and retire to peace 19 this sage cannot be shaken by thee any more than the mighty mountain Meru by the wind,moghaṁ śramaṁ nārhasi māra kartuṁ hiṁsrātmatāmutsṛja gaccha śarma |naiṣa tvayā kaṁpayituṁ hi śakyo mahāgirirmerurivānilena || 1357
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 58 Even fire might lose its hot nature water its fluidity earth its steadiness but never will he abandon his resolution who has acquired his merit by a long course of actions through unnumbered aeons,apyuṣṇabhāvaṁ jvalanaḥ prajahyādāpo dravatvaṁ pṛthivī sthiratvam |anekakalpācitapuṇyakarmā na tveva jahyādvyavasāyameṣaḥ || 1358
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 59 Such is that purpose of his that heroic effort that glorious strength that compassion for all beings — until he attains the highest wisdom he will never rise from his seat just as the sun does not rise without dispelling the darkness,yo niścayo hyasya parākramaśca tejaśca yadyā ca dayā prajāsu |aprāpya notthāsyati tattvameṣa tamāṁsyahatveva sahasraraśmiḥ || 1359
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 60 One who rubs the two pieces of wood obtains the fire one who digs the earth finds at last the water — and to him in his perseverance there is nothing unattainable — all things to him are reasonable and possible,kāṣṭhaṁ hi mathnan labhate hutāśaṁ bhūmiṁ khanan viṁdati cāpi toyam |nirbaṁdhinaḥ kiṁca na nāsya sādhyaṁ nyāyena yuktaṁ ca kṛtaṁ ca sarvam || 1360

https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 62 He who toilsomely pursues the one good path when all the world is carried away in devious tracks — he the guide should not be disturbed like a right informant when the caravan has lost its way,hṛte ca loke bahubhiḥ kumārgaiḥ sanmārgamanvicchati yaḥ śrameṇa |sa daiśikaḥ kṣobhayituṁ na yuktaṁ sudeśikaḥ sārtha iva pranaṣṭe || 1362
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 63 He who is made a lamp of knowledge when all beings are lost in the great darkness — it is not for a right-minded soul to try to quench him — like a lamp kindled in the gloom of night,sattveṣu naṣṭeṣu mahāṁdhakārairjñānapradīpaḥ kriyamāṇa eṣaḥ |āryasya nirvāpayituṁ na sādhu prajvālyamānastamasīva dīpaḥ || 1363
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 64 He who when he beholds the world drowned in the great flood of existence and unable to reach the further shore strives to bring them safely across — would any right-minded soul offer him wrong,dṛṣṭvā ca saṁsāramaye mahaughe magnaṁ jagatpāramaviṁdamānam |yaścedamuttārayituṁ pravṛttaḥ kaścinnayettasya tu pāpamāryaḥ || 1364
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 65 The tree of knowledge whose roots go deep in firmness and whose fibres are patience — whose flowers are moral actions and whose branches are memory and thought — and which gives out the law as its fruit — surely when it is growing it should not be cut down,kṣamāśipho dhairyavigāḍhamūlaścāritrapuṣpaḥ smṛtibuddhiśākhaḥ |jñānadrumo dharmaphalapradātā notpāṭanaṁ hyarhati vardhamānaḥ || 1365

https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 67 To-day is the appointed period of all those actions which have been performed by him for the sake of knowledge — he is now seated on this seat just as all the previous saints have sat,bodhāya karmāṇi hi yānyanena kṛtāni teṣāṁ niyato dya kālaḥ |sthāne tathāsminnupaviṣṭa eṣa yathaiva pūrve munayastathaiva || 1367

https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 72 When the flower-armed god 21 thus fled away vanquished with his hostile forces and the passionless sage remained victorious having conquered all the power of darkness the heavens shone out with the moon like a maiden with a smile and a sweet-smelling shower of flowers fell down wet with dew,yuvatiriva sahāsā dyauścakāśe sacaṁdrāsurabhi ca jalagarbhaṁ puṣpavarṣaṁ papāta || 1372
https//bitly/2wZqxm8, 73 22When the wicked one thus fled vanquished the different regions of the sky grew clear the moon shone forth showers of flowers fell down from the sky upon the earth and the night gleamed out like a spotless maiden 23a 23b,tathāpi pāpīyasi nirjite gate diśaḥ praseduḥ prababhau niśākaraḥ |divo nipeturbhuvi puṣpavṛṣṭayo rarāja yoṣeva vikalmaṣā niśā | 1373*
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 1 Then having conquered the hosts of Māra by his firmness and calmness he the great master of meditation set himself to meditate longing to know the supreme end,tato mārabalaṁ jitvā dhairyeṇa ca śamena ca |paramārthaṁ vijijñāsuḥ sa dadhyau dhyānakovidaḥ || 141
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 2 And having attained the highest mastery in all kinds of meditation he remembered in the first watch the continuous series of all his former births,sarveṣu dhyānavidhiṣu prāpya caiśvaryamuttamam |sasmāra prathame yāme pūrvajanmaparaṁparām || 142
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 3 In such a place I was so and so by name and from thence I passed and came hither’ thus he remembered his thousands of births experiencing each as it were over again,amutrāhamayaṁ nāma cyutastasmādihāgataḥ |iti janmasahasrāṇi sasmārānubhavanniva || 143
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 4 And having remembered each birth and each death in all those various transmigrations the compassionate one then felt compassion for all living beings,smṛtvā janma ca mṛtyuṁ ca tāsu tāsūpapattiṣu |tataḥ sattveṣu kāruṇyaṁ cakāra karuṇātmakaḥ || 144
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 5 Having wilfully rejected the good guides in this life and done all kinds of actions in various lives this world of living beings rolls on helplessly like a wheel,kṛtveha svajanotsargaṁ punaranyatra ca kriyāḥ |atrāṇaḥ khalu loko yaṁ paribhramati cakravat || 145
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 6 As he thus remembered to him in his strong self-control came the conviction All existence is insubstantial like the fruit of a plantain’,ityevaṁ smaratastasya babhūva niyatātmanaḥ |kadalīgarbhaniḥsāraḥ saṁsāra iti niścayaḥ || 146
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 7 When the second watch came he possessed of unequalled energy received a pre-eminent divine sight like the highest of all sight-gifted beings,dvitīye tvāgate yāme so dvitīyaparākramaḥ |divyaṁ cakṣuḥ paraṁ lebhe sarvacakṣuṣmatāṁ varaḥ || 147
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 8 Then by that divine perfectly pure sight he beheld the whole world as in a spotless mirror,tatastena sa divyena pariśuddhena cakṣuṣā |dadarśa nikhilaṁ lokamādarśa iva nirmale || 148
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 9 As he saw the various transmigrations and rebirths of the various beings with their several lower or higher merits from their actions compassion grew up more within him,sattvānāṁ paśyatastasya nikṛṣṭotkṛṣṭakarmaṇām |pracyutiṁ copapattiṁ ca vavṛdhe karuṇātmatā || 149
https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 10 These living beings under the influence of evil actions pass into wretched worlds — these others under the influence of good actions go forward in heaven,ime duṣkṛtakarmāṇaḥ prāṇino yāṁti durgatim |ime nye śubhakarmāṇaḥ pratiṣṭhaṁte tripiṣṭape || 1410

https//bitly/2vJMCXN, 21 And worse still than all these bodily tortures in hell seems to me the association of an intelligent man with the base,śārīrebhyo pi duḥkhebhyo nārakebhyo manasvinaḥ |anāryaiḥ saha saṁvāso mama kṛcchratamo mataḥ || | 1421*

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having returned home and greeted my mother (I said),So ’haṁ ghaṁ gatvā mātaram āpṣṭavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I also will go to another country’,Aham evaṁ deśāntaraṁ gamiṣyāmī’ ti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,My mother said,Mātā ma āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Son your father crossed the seas and went to another country and died there,Putra tava pitā samudram avatīrṇo deśāntaraṁ gata eva kāla-gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,You are my only son there is plenty of riches in the home stay (here) you should not go’,Tvam eka-putrakaḥ prabhūtaṁ ghe dravyaṁ tiṣṭhati na gantavyam’ iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I will not go’ I replied,Mayā na gacchāmī’ ti pratiśrutam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,So it was twice thrice and four times falling at my feet she prevented me,Evaṁ dvitīyaṁ ttīyaṁ caturtham apy āpāda-patanaṁ nivartitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,After an interval I again went to the park and my friends said,Kālāntareṇāham bhūyo ’py udyānaṁ gataḥ sahāyair uktaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Certainly we should go’,Avaśyaṁ gantavyam’ iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I will go’ I replied,Gamiṣyāmī’ ti mayā pratiśrutam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then when getting ready my mother having fallen at my feet near the door without moving (said),Atha mama prasthitasya mātā dvāre pāda-patanaṁ ktvā sthitā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Son it is not proper to leave me’,Putra nārhasi mām parityaktum’ iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then having kicked her on the head with my foot I left,Tasyāham mastake pādaṁ dattvā prakrāntaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Together with my five hundred friends I went to the sea shore,So ’ham pañcabhiḥ sahāya-śataiḥ sārdhaṁ samudra-kūlaṁ gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having undertaken the eight fasting day (rules) we crossed the sea,Aṣṭāṅga-samanvāgatam poṣadhaṁ ghya samudram avatīrṇaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Setting forth for the Land of Gold our ship beaten by the rough winds was destroyed and they all died,Suvarṇabhūmi-prasthitānām asmākaṁ viṣama-vātādyāhataḥ poto vinaṣṭaḥ te sarve kāla-gatāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But I after many days by some means crossed over the sea,Ahaṁ tu bahubhir divasaiḥ kathaṁcana samudrād uttīrṇo
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,then wearying (I saw) the golden wall of a city,’tha prapīḍyamānaḥ sauvarṇena prākāreṇa nagaram
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,furnished with pleasure parks groves and lakes,ārāma-sampannam vana-sampannam puṣkariṇī-sampannam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,with the smoke of incense loose flowers strewn about and having silk cloths attached and bunches of garlands,dhūpita-dhūpanam mukta-puṣpāvakīrṇam avasakta-paṭṭa-dāma-kalāpam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Four nymphs came out from there and with them I entered (into the city),Tasmāc catasro ’psaraso nirgatāḥ tābhiḥ praveśito ’smi
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I played with them for many years – I played for a hundred years a hundred thousand years,Yāvat tābhir api sārdham bahūni varṣāṇi – bahūni varṣa-śatāni bahūni varṣa-śata-sahasrāṇi krīḍitam

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As before,Pūrvavat
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,From there the nymphs came out and with them I entered (into the city),Tasmād apsaraso nirgatāḥ tābhiḥ praveśito ’smi
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I played with them for many years – I played for a hundred years a hundred thousand years,Yāvat tābhir api sārdham bahūni varṣāṇi bahūni – varṣa-śatāni bahūni varṣa-śata-sahasrāṇi krīḍitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,So with the (walls) made of beryl,Evaṁ vaidūrya-mayam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,From there sixteen nymphs came out …,Tasmād api ṣoḍaśāpsaraso nirgatāḥ …
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I came out from there,Tasmād api nirgatah
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I saw a city (with walls) made of crystal,Sphaṭika-mayaṁ nagaram paśyāmi
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As before,Pūrvavat
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,From there thirty-two nymphs came out,Tasmād dvā-triṁśad apsaraso nirgatāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I also played with them …,Tābhir api saha tathaiva krīḍitam …
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I arrived at a forest of thorns … up to I saw an iron city,kaṇṭakāṭavīm prapannaḥ … yāvad āyasa-nagaram paśyāmi
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I entered it,So ’ham atra praviṣṭaḥ

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And there …,Atra ca …
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As before,Pūrvavat
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I saw a man with a wheel having swords cutting through his head,Asidharaṁ cakraṁ śirasi parivartamānam paśyāmi
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having entered that place the wheel having swords crossed over onto my head,Tatra ca mamāvasthitasya śirasi asidharaṁ cakraṁ saṁkrāntam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What mother I … turned back,Yad aham mātu … nivttaḥ

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having kicked my mother on the head I left,Mātuḥ śirasi pādaṁ dattvā gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The result of that deed is that a wheel having swords cut my head”,Tasya karmaṇo vipākena mamāsidharaṁ cakraṁ śiraś chinatti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Maitrāyajña thought,Maitrāyajñaś cintayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I have done the exact same deed,Mayāpy etad eva karma ktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and now the result of my deed is near to hand’,upasthito mamāpi karma-vipāka’ iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The hell-being said,Nairayika-purusaḥ prāha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Who are you”,“Kutas tvam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Maitrāyajña said,Maitrāyajñaḥ kathayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“There is in the Rose-Apple Isle a great city called Tāmalipta,“Asti Jambudvīpe Tāmaliptaṁ nāma mahā-nagaram

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is all going to happen to me”,Mayāpi caitat sarvam anuṣṭheyam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The hell-being asked,Nairayika-puruṣaḥ prāha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Today I heard a noise in the firmament (saying),“Asti mayādyāntarikṣe ghoṣaḥ śrutaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“The result of your deed is exhausted,“Kṣīṇas tava karma-vipākaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Today the son of a caravan leader called Maitrāyajña will come,Maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putraḥ adyāgamiṣyati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,who has done the same deed’ ”,etad eva karma ktveti’ ”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Maitrāyajña said,Maitrāyajña āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“What is there to eat”,“Kim bhojanam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He said,Sa āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Only whatever pus and blood flows from your head after it is cut”,“Ata eva mastakāc chidyamānād yat pūya-śoṇitaṁ sravati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,After saying that that person fell down dead,Evam uktvā sa puruṣaḥ kāla-gataḥ patitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Maitrāyajña fearful and anxious,Maitrāyajño bhītaḥ saṁvignaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,after prostrating with his whole being to his mother and father said,sarveṇa bhāvena mātā-pitroḥ praṇipātaṁ ktvāha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Stretching from the top of existence to the Ceaseless hell,“Ūrdhvam bhavāgravitatān adharād Avīciṁ 
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,through countless pathways across the world systems,tiryak-prathān agaṇitān api loka-dhātūn
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,myself and the multitude of gods anti-gods men nāgas ghosts –,ātman-sva surāsura-naroraga-bhūta-kāye –
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,whatever beings approach – may they all be happy”,satvāni yāni upagatāni – sukhino bhavantu”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having thought thus and honouring mother and father with his whole being,Evaṁ cintayitvā sarveṇa bhāvena mātā-pitror namaskāraṁ ktvā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,he prostrated and made this aspiration,praṇipātaṁ ca praṇidhānaṁ ca ktavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Wherever I am reborn may I be of service to my mother and father,“Yatra yatropapadyāmi mātā-pitroḥ śuśrūṣāṁ kuryām aham iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whatever beings there are reborn in personal hells,Ye ca kecana satvā pratyeka-narake upapadyante
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,for the benefit of them all I remain here,teṣāṁ sarveṣām arthāyāham atrāvasthitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whatever beings there are in the world both bound and free I worship them,Ye ca kecana loke yuktāś ca muktāś ca teṣāṁ namaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,May they protect me”,Te mām pālayantu”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having said that in that hell-being’s place he stayed for some time,Idam uktvā tasmin nairayika-puruṣaḥ kāle sthitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And again he made an aspiration again saying,Punaś ca praṇidhānaṁ ktvā punar apy āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“From the Ceaseless hell to the top of existence,“Ktvādau narakam Avīcim ābhavāgrād 
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,whatever beings fall away and are bound and attached to (various) destinations,ye satvāś cyuti-gati-bandhanāvabaddhāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(may) they all be happy may they spend their time devoted to Dharma,te sarve sukham atināpya Dharma-yuktaṁ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and experience the ageless and deathless Nirvāṇa”,Nirvāṇaṁ yad ajaram acyutaṁ spśantu”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the wheel without touching his head all the time remained hovering in the sky,Atha tac cakram aspśamānaṁ śirasi nitya-kālam evopari vihāyasi sthitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And all the time it seems his mother was praying,Nityaṁ ca kila tasya mātā-śiṣam prayuṅkte
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“If there is some fruit of merit for me from giving,“Yady asti mama kiṁcit puṇya-phalam pradānena vā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,or from virtue or from the spiritual life or from the vows (I undertook),śīlena vā brahmacaryeṇa vā pativratatvena vā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,through the fruit of that merit may my son wherever he may be not have any misfortune”,tena puṇya-phalena mama putrasya yatra tatra sthitasya mā kiṁcit pāpam bhavatu”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And through that he was safe,Tena ca tasya śivam āsīt
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As in the Śyāma story  with a poisoned arrow …,Yathā Śyāma-jātake saviṣeṇa śareṇa …
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Because of the blessing of prince Śyāma’s mother and father,Śyāma-kumārasya mātā-pitror āśīr-vacanena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,the dart came out the poison was destroyed and he who was dead returned to life,śalyaś ca nirgato viṣaṁ ca naṣṭam mtaś ca saṁjīvitas
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Because of that (blessing) he was safe,Tadvat tasyāpi śivam āsīt
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as was said by the noble Śāradvatīputra  in the Dhanaṁjaya discourse  at the adamantine Rājagha,Yathā vajra-Rājaghe Dhanaṁjaya-sūtre ārya-Śāradvatīputreṇoktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“That brahmin honoured regularly his mother and father,“Tam enam brāhmaṇam mātā-pitarau samam mānitau
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and rightly worshipped them with a beautiful mind set on compassion,samyak pūjitau kalyāṇena manasānukampete
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Shaken their son (acted) according to righteousness virtuously,Adhosī vatana putro dhārmikeṇa karma-guṇena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and never did any wicked deed”,na ca kiṁcit pāpaṁ karma karoti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The whole discourse can be utilised (here),Sarvaṁ sūtraṁ yojyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in the Śivālaka discourse  the Fortunate One said,Yathā ca Śivālaka-sūtre Bhagavatoktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Householder’s son as your mother and father served you in five ways,“Tam evaṁ gha-pati-putra mātā-pitarau pañcasu sthāneṣu pratyupasthitau
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,so should you serve them in five ways,pañcasu sthāneṣu pratiṣṭhāpayataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Householder’s son again when an individual has compassion for his mother and father prosperity is to be expected”,Tasya punar gha-pati-putra mātā-pitbhyām anukampitasya puruṣa-pudgalasya vddhir evam pratyāśaṁsitavyā”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,So he remained feeding on joy for a full 60000 years,Sa tatra prīty-āhāraḥ sthitvā paripūrṇeṣu ṣaṣṭi-varṣa-sahasreṣu kāla-gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as king Ajātaśatru passed away before the (full) measure of life in hell was fulfilled ,Yathā rājājātaśatrur aparipūrṇa eva nairayikāyuḥ-pramāṇe cyutaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(But) as deeds are not barren he still had severe headaches,Abandhyatvāt karmaṇāṁ kadācid atīva śirorujā bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,We should also say here that after Maitrāyajña made his aspiration he was eager to obey his mother and father,Atra kta-praṇidhānasya Maitrāyajñasya mātā-pit-śuśrūṣā vaktavyā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in the Śyāma birth story his blind mother and father protected him with their hands,Yathā Śyāma-jātake ’ndhau mātā-pitarau hasti-bhūtena paripālitau
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And a hundred other birth stories,Anyeṣu jātaka-śateṣu ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the Fortunate One when the time had arrived addressed the monastics,Atha Bhagavān prāpta-kālam bhikṣūn āmantrayate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“It may be monastics that at that time on that occasion,“Syād evam bhikṣavo yuṣmākam anyaḥ sa tena kālena tena samayena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(you think) it was Maitrāyajña who became the son of a caravan leader,Maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putro babhūveti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It should not be seen like this,Naivaṁ draṣṭavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,At that time on that occasion I was Maitrāyajña the son of a caravan leader,Ahaṁ sa tena kālena tena samayena Maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putra āsīt
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Therefore monastics have faith in my words,Tasmāt tarhi bhikṣavo mama vacanaṁ śraddadhānair
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,You should have respect for the Buddha,Buddhe sagauravair bhavitavyaṁ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,You should have respect for the Dharma and the Saṅgha,Dharme Saṁghe sagauravair bhavitavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,You should have respect for your mother and father teachers and preceptors,Mātā-pitṣu ācāryopādhyāyeṣu sagauravair bhavitavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In this way you should train yourselves monastics,Evaṁ vo bhikṣavaḥ śikṣitavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whoever has gone to another country experiences both happiness and suffering,Ya evaṁ deśāntara-gataḥ sukhaṁ duḥkham pratyanubhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,just as Maitrāyajña when he had gone to another country,yathā Maitrāyajñena deśāntara-gatena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,there underwent in his life a personal heaven and a personal hell,tasminn eva janmani pratyeka-svargam pratyeka-narakaṁ cānubhūtam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(so) whoever has gone to another country experiences both happiness and suffering”,ya evaṁ deśāntara-gataḥ sukhaṁ duḥkham pratyanubhavati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed that has results in another country ,Idaṁ karma deśāntara-vipākam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This was shown by the Fortunate One,Etad darśayati Bhagavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“As with me so it is with mother and father teachers and preceptors,“Yathā mayi tathā mātā-pitṣu ācāryopādhyāyeṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The word spoken has the same result in this world and in the next world,Vacana-kāriṇāṁ samo vipākaḥ iha loke paraloke ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,How is the result of the deed the same in this world,Katham iha loke samaḥ karma-vipāko bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just like the poor man in Śrāvastī ,Yathā Śrāvastyāṁ daridra-puruṣo
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,after seeing the Fortunate One together with the Saṅgha of disciples eating,Bhagavantaṁ saśrāvaka-saṁgham bhuñjānaṁ dṣṭvā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,his mind became full of faith,cittam prasāditavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through this deed that he did he acquired a great heap of merit which led him to majesty,Tena mahā-puṇya-sambhāra upārjitaḥ rājya-saṁvartanīyaṁ karma ktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It was also the seed of his release (from saṁsāra),Tad eva ca mokṣa-bījam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Knowing this the Fortunate One spoke this verse ,Tac ca jñātvā Bhagavatā gāthā bhāṣitā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Those who rejoice here and those who serve,“Ye tatrābhyanumodante vaiyāvtyakarāś ca ye 
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,are not lacking in skill they are entitled to their merit”,anūnā dakṣiṇā teṣāṁ te ’pi puṇyasya bhāginaḥ”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the basis of the verse ,Etad eva gāthā samutthānam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Mind precedes thoughts mind is their chief (they are) impelled by mind,“Manaḥ-pūrvaṅgamā dharmā manaḥ-śreṣṭhā mano-javāḥ 
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,if with a pure mind one speaks or acts,manasā cet prasannena bhāṣate vā karoti vā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,through that happiness follows him like a shadow which does not depart”,tatas taṁ sukham anveti chāyā vā anuyāyinī”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then he passed away and was reborn amongst the gods,Tataś cyutaś ca deveṣūpapannaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as with the Independent Buddha called Tagaraśikhī ,Yathā ca Tagara-śikhī nāma Pratyeka-buddhaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In a time of famine he received a broth from a poor man,Durbhikṣe daridra-puruṣeṇa sūpaḥ pratipāditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and on that same day (the poor man) in that very city was anointed king,sa ca tad-ahar eva tasmin nagare rājābhiṣiktaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And after an interval of time he became an Independent Buddha,Tataḥ kālāntareṇa Pratyeka-buddhaḥ saṁvttaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He is mentioned in another discourse  (where) he is also called the Independent Buddha Tagaraśikhī,Ya eṣa sūtrantare paripaṭhitaḥ Pratyeka-buddhas Tagara-śikhī nāma
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,So from that mind full of faith in the Fortunate One he had an immediate fruit and result,Evaṁ tāvad Bhagavati sāṁdṣṭikaś citta-prasādasya phala-vipākaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,How is it with mother and father,Katham mātā-pitṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as Maitrāyajña the son of a caravan leader,Yathā Maitrāyajñaḥ sārtha-vāha-putraḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,four times was turned back by the word of his mother,ācaturtham pratinivtto mātur vacanena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(so) he experienced the pleasure of a personal heaven in four great cities,caturṣu mahā-nagareṣu pratyeka-svarga-sukham anubhūtavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and through that (planted) the seed of release (from saṁsāra),tat tu tasya mokṣa-bījam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,so he also had an immediate fruit and result through (respecting) mother and father,evam mātā-pitṣv api sāṁdṣṭikaḥ phala-vipākaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And how does one with corrupt mind towards the Fortunate One and mother and father go to hell,Katham Bhagavati mātā-pitṣu ca citta-pradoṣeṇa naraka-gamanam bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Devadatta through having a corrupt thought towards the Fortunate One fell into the great and Ceaseless hell”,“Devadatto Bhagavati cittam prato ’vīcau mahā-narake patitaḥ”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Likewise in the Sindhu realm  there was a city called Rauruka ,Tathā Sindhu-viṣaye Raurukaṁ nāma nagaram
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and there prince Śikhaṇḍī having killed his father fell into hell,tatra Śikhaṇḍī rāja-putraḥ pitaraṁ ghātayitvā narake patitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is how one with corrupt mind towards the Fortunate One and mother and father goes to hell,Evam Bhagavati mātā-pitṣu ca citta-pradūṣaṇena naraka-gamanam bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is there no differentiation made,Tena kāraṇena kiṁ nāsti nānā-karaṇam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“There is a great differentiation made”,“Mahāntaṁ nānā-karaṇam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One produced and accumulated the roots of wholesomeness that were acquired over one hundred thousand aeons and an uncountable (amount of time),Bhagavān aneka-kalpa-śata-sahasropārjita-kuśala-mūla-sambhūta-sambhāraḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When the path was unknown the Buddha attained it and pointed out the path to Awakening,Anutpannasya mārgasyotpādayitā Buddho Bodhāya mārgaṁ deśayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Therefore having faith (in him) has fruit and results that are immeasurable and in the end there is Nirvāṇa,Tasmin ktaḥ prasādo ’prameya-phala-vipākaḥ ante ca Nirvāṇam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(But) mother and father to not know the path to release,Mātā-pitror mokṣa-mārgo ’viditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Again mother and father’s word is not made for everyone,Api ca na sarvam mātā-pitror vacanaṁ kāryam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Some (parents’) minds are affected by wrong views and they say to their son,Santi kecin mithyā-darśanopahata-cittāḥ putrān bruvanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Come lead me to the wilderness (to die there),“Ehi mām avasanaṁ naya
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,this will be both for your good and happiness and for mine,tava ca bhaviṣyati hitāya sukhāya mama ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , or make me enter a fire”,tayāgnau vā praveśayeti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(But) this is not to be done,Tan naiva kartavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the reason,Kiṁ kāraṇam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Those who kill mother or father will certainly to to hell,Mātā-pitarau ghātayitvāvaśyaṁ naraka-gamanam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For this reason the Fortunate One did not allow the going-forth for one who had killed mother or father,Ataeva Bhagavatā pratiṣiddho na mātā-pit-ghātakaḥ pravrājayitavyaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and for him who has gone forth there is no higher ordination and there is no attainment of fruit,nāsti tasya pravrajyā nopasampadā nāsti phala-prāptiḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In this way it is prevented just as for mother and father so it is the same for teacher and preceptor,Evaṁ-vidhaṁ varjayitvān yathā sama-samā mātā-pitara ācāryopādhyāyāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,How is it the same,Kathaṁ ca sama-samā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Did not the Fortunate One say,Nanu Bhagavatoktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Mother and father have a love for a child that penetrates and remains as far as the bone-marrow,“Mātā-pitroḥ putra-sneho yāvad asthi-majjām āśritya tiṣṭhaty
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,for this reason without the permission of mother and father there is no going-forth”,ataeva mātā-pitbhyām ananujñātasya nāsti pravrajyā”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the Fortunate One did not give the going-forth to the noble Rāṣṭrapāla Śoṇa and others without (their respective) mother’s and father’s permission,Yathārya-Rāṣṭrapāla-Śoṇa-prabhtayo Bhagavatā mātā-pitarāv ananujñāpya na pravrājitāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and even today we do not give the going-forth without permission,adyāpi tān ananujñātān na pravrājayanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as with the going-forth of the Fortunate One (his father) Śuddhodana covered his eyes through grief for his son,Yathā ca Bhagavati pravrajite Śuddhodanasya putra-śokena cakṣuṣī antarhite
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said ,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Considering these five reasons mother and father wish for a child,“Mātā-pitaraḥ pañca sthānāni pratyāśaṁsamānāḥ putram icchanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , He will look after us when we are old, Śaṁvardhito no vddhī-bhūtān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , as he was protected so he will (protect us), pālayiṣyati kāryaṁ ca kariṣyati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , he will be master of our wealth, dravya-svāmī ca bhaviṣyati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , when we have died he will make the ancestor offerings, kāla-gatānāṁ ca pit-piṇḍaṁ dāsyati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , he will preserve our family lineage, kula-vaṁśaś ca cirasthitiko bhaviṣyati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,These are the five reasons mother and father wish for a child,Imāni pañca sthānāni pratyāśaṁsamānā mātā-pitaraḥ putram icchanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is not so with teachers and preceptors,Naivam ācāryopādhyāyāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,They act wholly out of kindness (thinking),Kevalam eva kāruṇyam purasktya
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“How could he make an end to the stream of time that rolls on in this wheel of saṁsāra”,“Katham asyā nādi-kāla-pravttasya saṁsāra-cakrasya paryantaṁ kuryād” iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As was said by the Fortunate One in the Discipline ,Yathā Bhagavatā Vinaya uktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Preceptors (should) perceive their students as sons,“Upādhyāyasya śiṣye putra-saṁjñā bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and students (should) perceive their preceptors as fathers,śiṣyasyāpy upādhyāye pit-saṁjñā bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,depending on each other in this way they will be happy”,evam anyonya-niśritāḥ sukhino bhaviṣyanti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In this way teacher and preceptor are the same as mother and father,Evam ācāryopādhyāyāḥ sama-samā mātā-pitbhiḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the Fortunate One said in the Discourse about the Universal Monarch ,Yathā Cakravarti-sūtra uktam Bhagavatā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“What is the deed having the result that the king the universal monarch receives elephant-jewels and horse-jewels” ,“Kasya karmaṇo vipākena rājā cakravartī hasti-ratnāny aśva-ratnāni ca pratilabhate”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For a long time the king the universal monarch carried his mother and father on his shoulders or had them transported in a chariot,Dīrgha-rātraṁ rājā cakravartī mātaram pitaraṁ vā svayaṁ vā skandhe vahati vā rathādibhir vāhayati vā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,or he had his teacher and preceptor transported,ācāryopādhyāyān svayaṁ vahati vāhayati vā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Because of this the result was that the king the universal monarch received elephant and horse jewels,Tasya karmaṇo vipākena rājā Cakravartī hasty-aśva-ratnāni pratilabhate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For this reason mother and father are the same as teachers and preceptors,Anenāpi kāraṇena sama-samā mātā-pitara ācāryopādhyāyāś ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,There is another differentiation made,Api tv asty anyatra nānā-karaṇam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,householders worship mother and father and those gone-forth,ghasthānām mātā-pit pravrajitāḥ pūjyāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,but those gone-forth must worship (only) teachers and preceptors,pravrajitānām ācāryopādhyāyā eva pūjanīyāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in the Mahīśāsaka lineage a different explanation has arisen and is remembered within their Discipline (thus),Yathā Mahīśāsakā gotrāntarīyā Vinaye ’rthotpattiṁ dhārayanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“As the Fortunate One said,“Yathāha Bhagavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Monastics one should not go to another country without having first paid respects to your teacher and preceptor ,Na bhikṣavaḥ ācāryopādhyāyān anāpṣṭvā deśāntaraṁ gantavyam’
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Why,Kasmād
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Monastics there is an obstacle to life an obstacle to the spiritual life an obstacle to the bowl and robes ,Bhavati bhikṣavo jīvitāntarāyo bhavati brahmacaryāntarāyo bhavati pātra-cīvarāntarāyaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Previously monastics there was a son of a caravan leader called Maitrāyajña…’ ”,Bhūta-pūrvam bhikṣavo Maitrāyajño nāma sārtha-vāha-putra āsīd iti…’ ”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This tradition is to be recited here just as it is,Etad evāvadānaṁ yathāvasthitaṁ vaktavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In this way mother and father are the same as teachers and preceptors,Evam eva sama-samā ācāryopādhyāyā mātā-pitaraś ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As was said by the Fortunate One ,Yathā coktam Bhagavatā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Monastics whoever would roam around the Rose Apple Isle carrying his mother and father on his shoulders,“Yo bhikṣavo mātā-pitarau skandhena ghya Jambudvīpam paryaṭeta
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and would support them and give them (all) the finest gold in the four continents,yogodvahanaṁ ca kuryāt caturṣu dvīpeṣu hiraṇya-suvarṇaṁ ca dadyāt
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,still would not have given back the help he had from his mother and father,evam api mātā-pitroḥ pratyupakāro na kto bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But whoever instils faith in the Buddha the Dharma the Sangha,Yaś ca punar Buddhe prasādayet Dharme Saṁghe
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and establishes them in the five virtuous precepts beloved of the noble ones,pañcasu śikṣā-padeṣu ārya-kānteṣu śīleṣu pratiṣṭhāpayet
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,in this way a son would have given back the help he had from mother and father”,evam mātā-pitṝṇām putraiḥ pratyupakāraḥ kto bhavati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Teachers and preceptors do all this,Tac ca sarvam ācāryopādhyāyāḥ kurvanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As is said by the Fortunate One in the discourse on the Analysis of Offerings ,Yathāha Bhagavān Dakṣiṇā-vibhaṅga-sūtre
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Just as Ānanda a person who because of another person has gone for refuge to the Buddha,“Yath’ Ānanda pudgalaḥ pudgalam āgamya Buddhaṁ śaraṇaṁ gacchati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,has gone for refuge to the Dharma and the Saṅgha…”,Dharmaṁ Saṁghaṁ śaraṇaṁ gacchati…”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The training rules should also be quoted,Yathoktāni ca śikṣāpadāni vaktavyāni
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Ānanda that person is not able to repay the other person,“Ten’ Ānanda pudgalena tasya pudgalasya na śakyam pratikartum
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,that is to say with worship rising up or with loving-kindness”,yad idam abhivādana-pratyutthāna-mātreṇaivam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Thus teachers and preceptors are again more distinguished than mothers and fathers,Api prativiśiṣṭa-tarā ācāryopādhyāyā mātā-pitbhyām
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as Mahākātyāyana entered Āvantī and converted the western countries ,Yathā ca Mahākātyāyanenāvanti-prabhtayaḥ paścima-janapadā abhiprasāditāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the noble Madhyandina tamed the five hundred nāgas in Kashmir and converted the district ,Yathā cārya-Madhyandinena Kāśmīrāyām pañca nāga-śatani vinīya deśo ’bhiprasāditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and having brought saffron from lake Anavatapta and established it in Kashmir,Anavatapta-sarasaś ca kuṅkumam ānīya Kaśmīrāyām pratiṣṭhāpitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,where it is still enjoyed in the world today,tac cādyāpi lokopabhuktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He also had a monastery built which is still inhabited today,Vihāraś ca kārito ’dyāpi ca tatraiva prativasanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the noble Gavāmpati converted the one-hundred league country (called) the Land of Gold,Yathā ārya-Gavāmpatinā Suvarṇabhūmyāṁ yojana-śataṁ janapado ’bhiprasāditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the noble Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja converted the Eastern Videhas and had monasteries built which are still inhabited today,Yathā ca Pūrva-videhā ārya-Piṇḍola-Bhāradvājenābhiprasāditā vihārāś ca kāritā adyāpi tatraiva prativasanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the noble Mahendra converted the fearsome rākṣasas with Vibhīṣaṇa at the fore in Śrī Laṅkā and at that time established the country (in faith),Yathā cārya-Mahendreṇa Siṁhala-dvīpe Vibhīṣaṇa-prabhtayo rākṣasāḥ samaye sthāpitā deśaś cābhiprasāditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in the discourse on The One Hundred and Fifty the noble Pūrṇa converted the five hundred lay disciples in Śūrpāraka,Yathā cādhyardha-śatake sūtra ārya-Pūrṇena Śūrpārake nagare pañcopāsaka-śatāni abhiprasāditāni
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and had the Sandalwood-forest monastery built,Candana-mālaś ca vihāraḥ kāritaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the Fortunate One together with five hundred monastics having gone through the air converted the people,Yathā ca Bhagavān pañcabhir bhikṣu-śataiḥ sārdhaṁ vihāyasā tatra gato jana-kāyaś cābhiprasāditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But why grasp at the names of these monastics,Api ca kim ekaikasya bhikṣor nāma-grahaṇena ktena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Since the Fortunate One attained Nirvāṇa …,Yato Bhagavān parinirva … ntar
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,whatever monks and nuns laymen and laywomen were guided,yaḥ kaścid vinīto bhikṣur vā bhikṣuṇī vopāsako vopāsikā vā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,they all were guided by the monastics,sarve te bhikṣubhir eva vinītāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whoever has converted him becomes for him a teacher and preceptor,Yaś ca yenābhiprasāditaḥ sa tasyācāryopādhyāyāś ca eta
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,…the Fortunate One (said),…ta Bhagavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Considering these five reasons mother and father wish for a child… ,“Mātā-pitaraḥ pañca sthānāni pratyanuśaṁsamānāḥ putram icchanti…
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But the teachers and preceptors out of kindness teach the Dharma (for the attainment) of Nirvāṇa,Ācāryopādhyāyās tu kāruṇyān Nirvāṇaṁ Dharmaṁ deśayanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For this reason teachers and preceptors are more distinguished than mother and father”,Anenāpi kāraṇena mātā-pitbhya ācāryopādhyāyāḥ prativiśiṣṭatarā” iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the reason it was said by the Fortunate One ,Ata evam āha Bhagavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Monastics if you have faith in the words of the Fortunate One,“Mama bhikṣavo vacanaṁ śraddadhānair Bhagavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,you must have supreme faith in the Dharma and the Sangha,paraḥ prasādaḥ kāryaḥ Dharme Saṁghe
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,you must have supreme faith in mother and father teachers and preceptors,mātā-pitṣv ācāryopādhyāyeṣu paraḥ prasādaḥ kāryaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,That will be for your happiness and welfare for a long time”,Tad vo bhaviṣyati dīrgha-rātraṁ hitāya sukhāyeti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed that has results in another country,Idaṁ karma deśāntara-vipākam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person first becomes happy and later becomes unhappy,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ sukhito bhūtvā paścād duḥkhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Being asked for a gift here someone first happily approves and rejoicing gives it,Ihaikatyo dānaṁ yācitaḥ samānaḥ pūrvam prahṣṭaḥ pratijānīte pramudito dadāti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But after giving he has regret,Dattvā ca khalu pratisārī bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he is reborn amongst humans he is reborn into a family which has great riches great wealth,Sa yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate āḍhyeṣu mahā-dhaneṣu mahā-bhogeṣu kuleṣūpapadyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,but later that wealth is lost and exhausted (so that) he later becomes poor,paścāt tasya te bhogāḥ parikṣayam paryādānaṁ gacchanti sa paścād daridro bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Like the noble Gopaka ,Yathārya-Gopakaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It seems that at the time of the Fully Awakened Buddha Kakucchanda he gave a milch cow to the Saṅgha of monks,Tena kila Kakucchande Samyak-sambuddhe bhikṣu-saṁghasya godhenur dattā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Later others blamed him (saying) “You did not do well in giving this”,Sa paścāt parair garhito “Na sādhu-kteyaṁ datteti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through that his mind was corrupted,Tena cittam pradūṣitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Wherever he was reborn in that place he (first) had great wealth,Sa yatra yatropapadyate tatra tatra mahā-dhano bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,but later because of that corrupt mind he became poor,paścāt tena cittapradoṣeṇa daridro bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In his last existence he was reborn in a certain house in the city of Rājagha,Paścime bhave ’pi Rājaghe nagare ’nyatarasmin ghe pratyājātaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and through that birth his mother died so his mother was killed through giving birth,tasya jāyamānasya mātā kāla-gatā anena mātā māritā jāyamānena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He was born at the time of the Root lunar mansion,Mūla-nakṣatre jāto ’yam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(Thinking) “Let this family not be uprooted through this inauspicious (event)”,“Mā nirmūlaṁ kulaṁ kariṣyaty amaṅgalo ’yam” iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,they abandoned (him) together with his mother in the charnel ground,mātrā sārdhaṁ śmaśāne utsṣṭaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through the power of his merit milk flowed from one of his mother’s breasts (and he lived on),Tatrāpi ca mātur eka-stanāt kṣīram pragharati tenaiva puṇyānubhāvena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he had grown up he went-forth under the Fortunate One,Vivddhaś ca Bhagavatā gatya pravrājitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Previously this whole story was told to the monastics by the Fortunate One,Etac ca sarvam anupūrveṇa Bhagavatā bhikṣūṇāṁ kathitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Thus he first gave a milch cow and through this faith arose,Evam anena pūrvaṁ kṣīra-dhenuḥ prasāda-jātena dattā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and later he was angry and this was the fruit of that deed,paścād vipratisārī saṁvttaḥ tasyedaṁ karma-phalam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,So he previously through a mind full of faith (planted) the seed of release,Yas tv asau pūrvakaś citta-prasādas tad evāsya mokṣa-bījam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the householder’s son Īśvara  in the great city of Campā,Yathā ca Campāyām mahā-nagaryām Īśvaro gha-pati-putraḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,With his hand he (had given) all his wealth to his dependents and dispatched them as merchants in the four directions,Tena bhtyānāṁ haste sarvaṁ dhanaṁ catur-diśam bāṇijyāya preṣitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having gone to another country all was lost,Tac ca sarvaṁ deśāntara-gataṁ vinaṣṭam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and it came about he had to work for others ,sa ca para-karma-karaḥ saṁvttaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed provided with which a person at first becomes happy and later becomes unhappy,Idaṁ karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ sukhito bhūtvā paścād duḥkhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person at first becomes unhappy and later becomes happy,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ duḥkhito bhūtvā paścāt sukhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Being asked someone takes a gift and approving of the same then gives (it to another) with difficulty,Ihaikatyo dānaṁ samādāya yācitaḥ samānaḥ pratijānīte kcchreṇa dadāti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But after giving the gift later joy arises,Dattvā tu dānam paścāt prītim utpādayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he is reborn amongst humans he is reborn into a family which is poor but later that wealth increases,Sa yadā manuṣyeṣūtpadyate daridreṣu kuleṣūtpadyate tasya paścāt te bhogā abhivddhiṁ gacchanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Here the tradition about Aniruddha should be told ,Atra cāniruddhasyāvadānaṁ vaktavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It seems that in Rājagha he gave a share of millet and rice as alms food to the Independent Buddha Upariṣṭha,Tena kila Rājaghe śyāmāka-taṇḍula-bhaktam Upariṣṭhasya Pratyeka-buddhasya piṇḍapāto dattaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,That day itself the king being satisfied gave him eight great villages,Tad-divasam eva rājñā tuṣṭenāṣṭau mahā-grāmā dattāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And later he was  poor,Tac ca paścimakaṁ  dāridryam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For him it was just as in the explanation in the Past and Future discourse ,Yathā tasyaiva vyākaraṇam Pūrvāparāntake sūtre
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in Śrāvastī a poor man having asked his kinsmen for fruits took them to a field in order to plant them,Yathā ca Śrāvastyāṁ daridra-puruṣeṇa svajana-phalāni yācitvā kṣetraṁ nītāni karṣaṇārthe
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,His wife having delivered food to another house had brought back rice and prepared it as alms food,Tasya patnyā para-ghe bhājanam ādhāya vrīhim ānīya bhaktaṁ siddham
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the Fortunate One said this to some (monastics) including Śāriputra Maudgalyāyana Mahākāśyapa and Subhūti,Atha Bhagavatā Śāriputra-Maudgalyāyana-Mahākāśyapa-Subhūti-prabhtayaḥ ete uktāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“You should receive the alms food first at the home of this householder”,“Amukasya gha-pater ghe prathamam bhaikṣyaṁ grahītavyam” iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,They all went there first and they all received alms food from there,Te ca sarve yathānupūrvaṁ tatra gatāḥ sarvaiś ca tasmād bhaikṣyaṁ labdham
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then later the Fortunate One also went,Atha paścād Bhagavān api gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then that woman with faith arisen gave all the remaining alms food to the Fortunate One and made this aspiration,Tayā striyā jāta-prasādayā pariśiṣṭam bhaktaṁ sarvam Bhagavato dattam praṇidhānaṁ ca karoti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Fortunate One by the root of this wholesome deed may I never again be poor”,“Anena Bhagavan kuśala-mūlena mā me bhūyaḥ kadācid dāridryaṁ syād” iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“So be it” the Fortunate One replied,“Tathāstv” iti Bhagavatā pratiśrutam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,That very day a great hidden treasure appeared to her,Tad-ahar eva tasya mahā-nidhānam prādur-bhūtam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having heard that king Prasenajit went to that home and said this,Tac chrutvā rājā Prasenajit tasmin ghe gataḥ tenoktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Our former kings deposited these gold coins”,“Asmākam pūrva-rājabhis te dīnārāḥ sthāpitā” iti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Therefore the householder gave to him an abundance with reverence (but) they became ashes,Gha-patinā tasya tato ghyāñjali-pūro dattaḥ aṅgāraḥ saṁvttaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The king gave them to the householder again and they became gold,Rājñā bhūyo ghapater dattāḥ suvarṇaṁ saṁvttam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then king Prasenajit with wonder arisen having gone to the Fortunate One informed (him),Athā rājā Prasenajid vismaya-jātaḥ gatvā Bhagavato nivedayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One said,Bhagavān āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“The merit that arose was not grasped at by the householder…” and all is as related before,“Puṇya-nirjātā ghapater na grāhyā…” sarvaṁ ca tadānupūrveṇa kathitam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Thus when he was asked this was given with difficulty (but) he approved it,Evam eṣa yadā dātā bhavati duḥkhena yācitaḥ samānaḥ pratijānīte
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He gave with difficulty but after giving his mind was full of faith,Duḥkhena dadāti dattvā ca cittam prasādayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For this reason previously having been poor later he became one of great wealth,Tena hetunā pūrvaṁ daridro bhūtvā paścān mahā-dhano bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed provided with which a person at first becomes unhappy and later becomes happy,Idaṁ karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ duḥkhito bhūtvā paścāt sukhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person is at first happy and later is also happy,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ ca paścāc ca sukhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Being asked for a gift here someone first happily approves and happily gives it,Ihaikatyo dānaṁ yācitaḥ sa prahṣṭaḥ pratijānīte prahṣṭo dadāti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,After giving he is also joyous,Dattvāpi ca prītimān bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he is reborn amongst humans he is reborn into a family which is well off having great wealth great riches,Sa yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate āḍhyeṣu kuleṣūpapadyate mahā-dhaneṣu mahā-bhogeṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Here the result for the four master-donors including Miṇḍhaka  in Bhadrika city should be spoken,Atra Bhadrike nagare Miṇḍhaka-prabhtīnāṁ caturṇāṁ dāna-patīnāṁ vipāko vaktavyaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It seems they gave alms food to the Independent Buddha Tagaraśikhī,Taiḥ kila Tagaraśikhī Pratyeka-buddhaḥ piṇḍapātena pratipādilaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Here the tradition in the discipline should (also) be spoken,Atra Vinayāvadānaṁ vaktavyam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed provided with which a person is at first happy and later is also happy,Idaṁ karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ ca paścāc ca sukhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person is at first and also later unhappy,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalaḥ pūrvaṁ ca paścāc ca duḥkhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Someone here is bereft of spiritual friends and does not give a gift,Ihaikatyaḥ kalyāṇa-mitra virahito bhavati sa dānaṁ na dadāti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But he also does not commit any wicked deed,Na ca tena kiṁcit pāpakaṁ karma ktam bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he is reborn amongst humans he is reborn into a family which is poor that has little food and drink to enjoy,Sa yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate daridreṣu kuleṣūpapadyate alpānna-pāna-bhojaneṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as was explained in Śrāvastī in the Tradition about the Poor Boy ,Yathā Śrāvastyāṁ Daridra-dārakasyāvadānaṁ varṇayanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In Śrāvastī it seems the Fortunate One was roaming about for alms food,Śrāvastyāṁ kila Bhagavān piṇḍapātam paryaṭati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then in Śrāvastī it was (the day) known as the Twelve Sugar-canes,Tadā ca Śrāvastyām Ikṣu-dvā-daśī nāma bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and the Fortunate One received sugar-cane,Bhagavatā cekṣūṇi labdhāni
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,A certain poor boy stood in the doorway,Anyatarasmin gha-dvāre daridra-dārakas tiṣṭhati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and asked the Fortunate One for sugar-cane,sa Bhagavantam ikṣūṇi yācati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One gave some,Bhagavataikaṁ dattam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He again asked from the Fortunate One,Sa bhūyo yācati Bhagavān āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“My dear say this I do not desire it’ and I will give it again”,“Vatsa ucyatām Necchāmīti’ te bhūyo dāsyāmīti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He said,Sa prāha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Fortunate One I have never said I do not desire’ previously”,“Mayā Bhagavan na kadācin Necchāmīty’ uktam pūrvam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One said,Bhagavān āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“My dear say this I do not desire Fortunate One’ and I will give it all”,“Vatsa ucyatāṁ Necchāmi Bhagavan’ sarvāṇi dāsyāmīti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Out of greed for the sugar-cane he said I do not desire it’,Tenekṣulobhān Necchāmīty’ uktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One gave him all,Bhagavatā sarvāṇi dattāni
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the noble Ānanda asked,Athāryānandaḥ pcchati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Fortunate One why is this”,“Bhagavan kim idam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One said,Bhagavān āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Never before Ānanda has he been satiated with forms tastes smells touches and so on,“Na kadācid eṣa Ānanda rūpa-rasa-gandha-sparśādīnāṁ tpta-pūrvo ’bhavat
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and never before has he said I do not desire it’,Necchāmīti’ vā na kadācid ukta-pūrvam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This word of his I do not desire it’ will be the cause (of few desires)”,Tad etasya vacanaṁ tasya Necchāmīti’ hetu-bhūtam bhaviṣyati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And he said,Āha ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“ I do not desire it’ this utterance was never spoken before,“ Necchāmīty’ eṣa vyāhāro na kadācid udīritaḥ 
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,From where come forms and sounds from where come smells and touches,Kuto rūpāṇi śabdāś ca gandhāḥ sparśāś ca vai kutah
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Praying in this way the fool roams on constantly,Ity evam prārthayann eṣa nityam bhramati bāliśaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,I do not desire it’ – uttering this speech with joy,Necchāmīti’ – praharṣeṇa yaiṣā vāk samudīritā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,will be for him the cause of few desires”,hetur alpecchatā yaiṣā sa evāsya bhaviṣyati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed provided with which a person is at first and also later unhappy,Idaṁ karma yena samanvāgataḥ pūrvaṁ ca paścāc ca duḥkhito bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person is well off but selfish,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgala āḍhyo bhavati matsarī
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Someone gives a small gift in the bowl here to someone who is virtuous but he does not repeat the generous practice again,Ihaikatyenālpa-mātraṁ dānaṁ dattam bhavati śīlavati pātra-bhūte na tu punas tyāga-cittam abhyastam bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he is reborn amongst humans he is reborn into a family which is well off having great wealth great riches through that particular gift, yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate āḍhyeṣu kuleṣūpapadyate mahā-dhaneṣu mahā-bhogeṣu tena dāna-viśeṣeṇa
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But because he does not repeat that generous practice again his deeds become selfish,Yat tena punas tyāga-cittam abhyastaṁ na bhavati sa tena karmaṇā matsarī bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in the tradition about the householder Hilliśāla at Śrāvastī,Yathā Śrāvastyāṁ Hilliśāla-gha-pater avadānam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He it seems in a previous birth was selfish,Sa kila pūrva-janmani matsarī bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the Independent Buddha called Tagaraśikhī came to his doorway,Atha tasya gha-dvāre Tagaraśikhī nāma Pratyeka-buddha āgataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He gave alms food to him,Tasya bhikṣā dattā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then having seen him carrying it away having regret he didn’t give alms food (again),Tena dṣṭvādīyamānā tena kṣavaṇaye na ca bhikṣā dattā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and the monk vanished,sa ca pravrājitaḥ paribhraṣṭaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through this deed he experienced success amongst gods and men,Sa tena karmaṇā divya-mānuṣyakāḥ sampattayonubhūya
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and being reborn as a son of a high family in Śrāvastī he was selfish and (later) died,Śrāvastyām agra-kulika-putraḥ pratyājāto matsarī kāla-gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,King Prasenajit took the wealth of the one without heir,Tasya dravyaṁ rājñā Prasenajitāputrakaṁ ghītvā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(as is told) in the One Hundred Chapters Scripture in the Thematic (Discourses) about Prasenajit in the discourse called the Distribution of the King,Śata-varge Āgame Prasenajit-saṁyukteṣu Rājopakīrṇakaṁ nāma sūtram
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Prasenajit said to the Fortunate One,Prasenajid Bhagavataḥ kathayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Here Fortunate One one of high family has died,“Iha Bhagavann agra-kulikaḥ kāla-gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having no heir his property has been taken by me”,Tasya mayāputrakaṁ svāpateyaṁ ghītam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One said,Bhagavān āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Great king how much is the wealth of that householder worth”,“Katīyam Mahārāja gha-pater dravyaṁ ghītam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He said,Sa āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Fortunate One whatever has been fixed is a hundred times a hundred thousand but the rest of his wealth is without measure and cannot be fixed”,“Śatam Bhagavan śata-sahasrāṇāṁ yad āhatam pariśiṣṭaṁ dravyam aparimitam anāhatam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The Fortunate One said,Bhagavān āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Great king this is the seventh time the one without heir has had his wealth taken away,“Idaṁ tasya mahā-rāja saptamam aputrakaṁ dravya-grahaṇam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whatever (merit he gained) by supplying the Independent Buddha called Tagaraśikhī with alms food,Yat tena Tagaraśikhī nāma Pratyeka-buddhaḥ piṇḍapātena pratipāditaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,that deed is exhausted for him,tad asya karma parikṣīṇam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and he has made no other wholesome roots,anyac ca kuśala-mūlaṁ na ktam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Today is the first night he is being cooked in the Great Screaming hell”,Tenādya prathamāyāṁ rātryām Mahāraurave narake pacyate”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the Fortunate One spoke these verses,Tatra Bhagavān gāthā bhāṣate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Wealth corn gold cows horses jewels earrings,“Dhanaṁ dhānyaṁ jāta-rūpaṁ gavāśva-maṇi-kuṇḍalam 
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,slaves servants dependants – and others who live dependent on him,dāsa-karma-karā bhtyā – ye cānye anujīvinaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When dying these do not follow one he goes without taking them along,Mriyamāṇasya  nānveti nāpi ādāya gacchati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,But whatever deed there is good and then bad,Yat tena ktam bhavati kalyāṇam atha pāpakam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,that is his own he goes and takes that along,tad dhi tasya svakam bhavati tac ca ādāya gacchati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Therefore do meritorious deeds accumulate them for the next world,Tasmāt kuruta puṇyānāṁ nicayaṁ sāmparāyikam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,meritorious deeds are his in the next world recall them as the support for living beings,puṇyāni para-lokesmin pratiṣṭhā prāṇināṁ smtā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He leaves his body in the house while loved kin lie in the charnel ground,Ghe tiṣṭhati kāyoyaṁ śmaśāne priya-bāndhavāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,when going both good deeds and bad deeds follow one along”,suktaṁ duṣktaṁ caiva gacchantam anugacchati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD , this person is well off but selfish, ayam pudgala āḍhyo bhavati matsarī
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person is poor but generous,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalo daridro bhavati tyāgavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Someone gives many a gift here (but) to animals and to those without virtue who do not live the spiritual life,Ihaikatyena pudgalena bahu dānaṁ dattam bhavati tiryag-gateṣu manuṣyeṣu ca duḥśīleṣv abrahmacāriṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Again and again he repeats his generosity,Punaḥ punas tyāga-cittam abhyastam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,When he is reborn amongst humans he is poor but because of repeating that gift he is generous,Sa yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate daridro bhavati tyāgavān tena dānābhyāsena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whoever gives a gift into the bowls (of those without virtue) because of that becomes poor,Yat tu tenāpātra-bhūteṣu dānaṁ dattaṁ tena daridraḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as was explained in the origin story of the weaver in the Discipline there in Śrāvastī ,Yathā Śrāvastyāṁ tatra Vinaye tantra-vāyasya nidānam varṇayanti
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He was generous but poor,Sa tyāgavān daridraś ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Again and again he had the thought of generosity,Punaḥ punas tyāga-cittam abhyastam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed provided with which a person is poor but generous,Idaṁ karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgalo daridro bhavati tyāgavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,What is the deed provided with which a person is well off and generous,Katamat karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgala āḍhyo bhavati tyāgavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Someone gives many a gift here into the bowls of those are virtuous,Ihaikatyena pudgalena bahu dānaṁ dattam bhavati śīlavatsu pātra-bhūteṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and he repeats the generous practice again and again,punaḥ punas tyāga-cittam abhyastam bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through that deed when he is reborn amongst humans,Sa tena karmaṇā yadā manuṣyeṣūpapadyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,he is reborn into a family which is well off having great wealth great riches,āḍhyeṣu kuleṣūpapadyate mahā-dhaneṣu mahā-bhogeṣu
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And because he repeated that gift again and again he became generous,Yat tu tena punaḥ punas tyāgacittam abhyastaṁ tena tyāgavān bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as Anāthapiṇḍada it seems dedicated the Jetavana in the time of the Perfect Sambuddha Krakucchanda  and had a monastery built there,Yathānāthapiṇḍadena kila Krakucchande Samyak-saṁbuddhe Jetavanaṁ niryātitam vihāraś ca kāritaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Also in this way (in the times of) the Perfect Buddhas Kanakamuna Kāśyapa and Sarvārthasiddha,Evaṁ Kanakamunau Samyak-saṁbuddhe Kāśyape Sarvārthasiddhe ca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And again for Maitreya he will dedicate it by covering it with gold,Bhūyaś ca Maitreyasya suvarṇāstīrṇaṁ niryātayiṣyati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the deed provided with which a person is well off and generous,Idaṁ karma yena samanvāgataḥ pudgala āḍhyo bhavati tyāgavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,For which person is life exhausted but not his deeds,Katamasya pudgalasyāyuḥ kṣīṇaṁ na karma
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Whatever person who falling from hell is reborn in hell,Yaḥ pudgalo narakāc cyuto narakeṣūpapadyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,falling from the animal realm is reborn in the animal realm,tiryagbhyaś cyutas tiryakṣūpapadyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,falling from the Yama world is reborn in the Yama world,Yama-lokāc cyuto Yama-loke upapadyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,falling from the gods is reborn amongst the gods,devebhyaś cyuto deveṣūpapadyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as with the brahmin Varṣākāra who died and was reborn again and again as a monkey ,Yathā Varṣākārasya brāhmaṇasya punaḥ punaḥ kāla-gatasya markaṭopapattiḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as with the Kashmir householder spoken about previously who was reborn again and again as a bull ,Yathā Kāśmīrāyām pūrvoktasya gha-pateḥ punaḥ punaḥ paśūpapattiḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as in Śrāvastī there was a certain poor landholder who died,Yathā ca Śrāvastyāṁ kaścid daridraḥ kuṭumbī kāla-gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In his doorway stood a bull with a wound on his shoulder,Tasya gha-dvāre balī-vardo vraṇī-bhūtena skandhena tiṣṭhati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,That landholder’s mind was attached to his home and he was reborn as a worm on the shoulder of that bull,Sa gha āsakta-cittaḥ kuṭumbī tasya balī-vardasya skandhe kmiḥ pratyājātaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The moment he was reborn he was eaten by a crow,Upapanna-mātraś ca kākena bhakṣitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Again he was reborn as a worm right there,Punas tatraiva kmiḥ pratyājātaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,thus it happened that he died seven times in one day,sa evaṁ sapta-ktva eka-divasena kāla-gataḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The moment he was reborn he was eaten by a crow,Upapanna-mātraś ca kākena bhakṣitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the noble Mahāmaudgalyāyana while roaming for alms food in Magadha arrived at a certain home,Yathā cārya-Mahāmaudgalyāyano Magadheṣu bhaikṣyam paryaṭamānonyatama-gha-dvāram anuprāptaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,In that home the householder together with his wife were taking their meal consisting of fish and meat,Tasmiṁś ca ghe gha-patiḥ patnī-sahito matsya-māṁsa-prakāreṇa bhojanam bhuṅkte
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He held his son on his lap and a black bitch stood in front of him,Putreṇa paryaṅka-gatena kṣṇā cāsya kukkurī puraḥ sthitā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and he cast fish bones at her,sa tasya matsyā sthīni kṣipati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the householder having seen Mahāmaudgalyāyana said,Atha sa gha-patir Mahāmaudgalyāyanaṁ dṣṭvāha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Go away noble sir there is no one here who will give you alms”,“Gamyatām ārya nāsti kāścid atra yo bhikṣāṁ dāsyati”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He went away,Sa khalu samprasthitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,At that doorway were some wise men who had come from another country,Taśmiṁś ca gha-dvāre deśāntarābhyāgatāḥ puruṣā vidvāṁsaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and having seen that they became full of wonder (and said),pūrva-sthitāḥ te taṁ dṣṭvā vismayam prāptāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Alas it is amazing this one is known as the one with foremost spiritual powers,“Aho āścaryam ayaṁ nāma ddhi-matām agryaḥ

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,he has surely returned without alms food rejected”,sa nāma bhikṣām adattvā visarjitaḥ”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the elder to stir their spiritual anxiety said,Atha sthaviras teṣāṁ saṁvejanārtham āha
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Dears this is not amazing” ,“Vatsa naitad āścaryam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The men said,Puruṣā ūcuḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Then what else is amazing and a reason for wonder”,“Atha kim anyad āścaryaṁ vismaya-kāraṇam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He said,Sa uvāca
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“This householder taking his meal consisting of fish and meat,“Ya eṣa gha-patir matsya-māṁsa-prakārair bhojanaṁ bhuṅkte

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Also this bitch is the householder’s mother,Yāpy eṣā kukkurī asyaiva gha-pater mātā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Because of her greed and hatred she never gave any gifts,Etayā lobha-doṣeṇa na kiṁcid dānaṁ dattam

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,And the son he holds on his lap was this woman’s secret lover,Atha yas tv eṣa putraḥ paryaṅke ktaḥ eṣosyā eva striyāḥ pracchanna-bhartā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,He heard from another about his wife This your wife has become attached to another man’,Anena ca gha-patinā śrutam Eṣā te patnī para-puruṣa-vyāsaktā jāteti’
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The householder under the pretext of a journey to another village departed from the home,Sa eṣa gha-patir grāmāntara gamana-vyapadeśena ghān niṣkrāntaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,His wife slept with the other man,Eṣāpi strī para-puruṣeṇa saha śayitā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,At night the householder came back and killed the man,Anena gha-patinā rātrāv āgamya puruṣo ghātitaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,(The man’s) mind being attached to the woman by the bonds of love he was reborn in her womb,Sosyām eva striyām āsakta-cittas tenaiva snehānubandhena kukṣav upapannaḥ

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is an amazing thing here”,Idam atrāścaryakāraṇam”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the monk Mahāmaudgalyāyana for the benefit of all,Atha sa bhikṣur Mahāmaudgalyāyana etad evārthaṁ sarvam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,summed it up in a verse for the spiritual anxiety of future generations,paścima-janatā-saṁvejanārthaṁ ślokena saṁghītavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Like this he spoke,Yathāha

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,There a great crowd of people cried out,Tatra mahā-jana-kāyo rudati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then the monks went in the middle of the day and having seen this anxiously reported it to the Fortunate One (saying),Atha bhikṣavo divā-vihāraṁ gatāḥ taṁ dṣṭvā saṁvignā Bhagavato nivedayanti

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Again great king that householder’s good deed is exhausted for him and he has made no other (merit),“Tasya punar mahā-rāja gha-pates tac ca kuśalaṁ karma parikṣīṇam anyac ca na ktam

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Then with his mouth full of dirt he came to death,Pāṁśu-pūrṇena  mukhenātha maraṇam mtaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This was a result of the alms food he had previously given an Independent Buddha ,Pratyeka-buddha-pūrvas tasya piṇḍa-pātasya vipākena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the person whose life is exhausted and his merits,Ayam pudgalo yasyāyuś ca kṣīṇam puṇyāni ca

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the person whose life is not exhausted nor his deeds but (some) defilements are exhausted,Ayam pudgalo yasya nāyuḥ kṣīṇaṁ  karma api tu kleśāḥ kṣīṇāḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Which is the person who is happy in body but not in mind,Katamaḥ pudgalaḥ kāyena sukhī na cittena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It is said,Ucyate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,An ordinary person who has done merit is happy in body but not in mind,Kta-puṇyaḥ pthag-janaḥ kāyena sukhī na cittena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Like the very wealthy brahmin householders and king Māndhātā ,Yathā mahā-dhana-brāhmaṇa-gha-patayo rājā ca Māndhātā

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as the noble Soṇottara it seems in a previous life,Yathārya Śoṇottaras tena kila pūrva-janmani
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,had given cow-dung mixed with itching powder for bathing to an Independent Buddha,Pratyeka-buddhasya snāyato gomaya-piṇḍakaḥ kapikacchu-miśraḥ snānārthaṁ dattaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Because of the result of that deed his body was destroyed by leprosy,Tena karma vipākena kuṣṭhena śarīraṁ viśīryati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Therefore the verse says,Tathā hi gāthā bhāṣitā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Deeds are surely the strongest because deeds are (hard) like diamonds,“Karmāṇi nūnam balavattarāṇi karmabhyo vajra-kalpebhyaḥ

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as with Kāśyapa the Late ,Yathā ca Jaṅghā-Kāśyapaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,It seems in Vārāṇasī he had replied to an Independent Buddha,Tena kila Vārāṇasyām Pratyeka-buddhasya pratiśrutam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“I will give alms food”,“Bhaktaṁ dāśyāmīti”
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,After a great deal of effort he gave alms food near the end of the time (for giving),Sa tasya mahatā pariśrameṇa kālātikramaṇe āsanne bhaktaṁ dattavān
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through this deed having become free from lust in a later life,Sa tena karmaṇā paścime janmani vīta-rāgopi bhūtvā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,he roamed in the morning for alms,pūrvāhṇe piṇḍapātam paryaṭati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Near the end of the time (for giving) he received some alms food,Kālātikramaṇe āsanne kathaṁcid bhaktaṁ labhate
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through this he was called Kāśyapa the Late,Tathāsya Jaṅghā-Kāśyapa eva nāma
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the person who is happy in mind but not in body,Ayam pudgalaś cittena sukhī na kāyena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Which is the person who is happy in body and in mind,Katamaḥ pudgalaḥ kāyena sukhī cittena ca

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,The worthy one who has destroyed the pollutants and made merit,Arhan kṣīṇāsravaḥ kta-puṇyaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as with Bakula  the son of king Dharmayaśa of Kashmir,Yathā Kaśmīra-rājā Dharmayaśaḥ-putro Bakulaḥ

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Having become a perfume seller in Vārāṇasī it seems,Tena kila Vārāṇasyāṁ gāndhika-baṇijā bhūtvā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,he had invited the Perfect Sambuddha Kakucchanda together with his disciples with medicine to help when sick,Kakucchandaḥ Samyak-sambuddhaḥ saśrāvaka-saṁgho glāna-bhaiṣajyenopanimantrito
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and some of the Arahat monastics received myrobalan,bhikṣuṇā cārhatā ekā harītakī ghītā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Through this deed the result was he was never sick,Sa tasya karmaṇo vipākena nirābādhaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,“Health is the supreme gain”  said the Fortunate One,“Ārogya-paramā lābhā” uktā Bhagavatā
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,Just as was said about the noble Aniruddha ,Yathā cāryāniruddhaḥ kathayati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As a result of his (giving) alms food  venerables,Tasya khalv āyuṣmantaḥ piṇḍapātasya vipākena
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,seven times he was reborn amongst the excellent chapter of gods of the Thirty-Three,sapta-ktvaḥ praṇīte Trayastriṁśa-deva-nikāye upapannaḥ
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,and seven times he ruled over men,sapta-ktvo manuṣyeṣu rājyaṁ kāritam
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,As a result of his (giving) alms food he received the fruit of Arahatship,Tasyaiva ca piṇḍapātasya vipākenārhatva-phala-lābhī

https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,So through his giving to five-hundred monastics together with the Fortunate One in a time of famine,Tathā hi tasya Bhagavatā durbhikṣe pañca bhikṣu-śatāni dattāni
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,the power of his merit was that all this endless and divine alms food manifested,tasya puṇyānubhāvena sarveṣāṁ divyam ananta-bhaktam prādur-bhavati
https//bitly/2Rwa2eD ,This is the person who is happy in body and in mind,Ayam pudgalaḥ kāyena sukhī cittena ca

https//bitly/2rOTC6u ,She said,Sāha
https//bitly/2rOTC6u ,“With the arising of that (awakening) thought there will no longer be a garland for me again” and it disappeared,“Cittotpādād evāsyā mā me bhūyo mālā bhavatv ity” antarhitā
https//bitly/2rOTC6u ,Having seen this a god wondering recited a verse and spoke like this,Tāṁ ca dṣṭvā vismaya-prāptā devatā gāthām anugāyate yathāha
